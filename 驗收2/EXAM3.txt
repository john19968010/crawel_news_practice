Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I will now announce the results!
Go ahead and return to our childhood days by the time machine!
I like UFOs.
Yes, she does!
It's yours, honey.
I'm not going to escape, hide or use inventions.
Ehimo-gaoka? What's "chome"?!
He is taking a picture of the court ladies.
Did you hear about the grouping?
Last year she went to the bean-throwing at Zojo-ji.
Doc, P-L-E-A-S-E fold my spacesuit.
Orihime and Hikoboshi are not meeting now.
Please use them at school and improve your memory.
Take the machine to the locker room.
When you put it in the washing machine, take off the helmet!
Yes!
Oh, the cherry blossoms!
What's wrong, Iroha?
Little Red Riding Hood left her lodge to go to Little Rock but took the wrong road, which led her to an unfamiliar place.
One afternoon in early March, Charlotte was working alone in her art gallary.
They are all fighters from my planet.
So many strawberries was a bad idea.
No, Mr. Haruno!
Yes, Naram! Yes!
He's lost and sad.
Amane, let's play cards!
You look cheerful.
He plugged the hole with one of the two oars and set the boat afloat in a nearby lake.
I'll take some dice and glue one into each shoe.
I have a toothache.
Are you all right?
I'm sleepy.
But one day someone stole the cup from his hut.
Did Sarah enjoy the Great Buddha?
Yes, I do.
I can make a "C".
south north
I caught a bag of beans!
I took off a few snakes.
I can't make a "C".
Can you make a "Z"?
I'm writing letters on these sunglasses, but it's difficult.
He's going to attack us!
V
SHO: GO NORTH IMO: GO SOUTH
And today I made another.
He is a boxer from my planet.
This is my champion-of-the-universe belt.
Yes. / No.
It's next to the station.
It's on the third floor.
Like father, like son.
She's in the library.
Where's your sister?
You are a great snowboarder, Takumi!
It was a piece of cake.
How was your day today?
I have a dentist appointment.
It reminds me of our neighbor Mr. Sasaki!
The word-of-mouth campaign is already underway!
I don't have a good feeling about this...
Becky, can you tell us something about Halloween?
They go from house to house.
They say, "Trick or treat?"
What do you wonder, dear?
I don't get it.
Because she can't get over her destiny.
Oh, I shouldn't say that.
The early bird catches the worm.
A little rain won't stop me!
On the evening of Halloween children wear costumes.
And they get lots of candies from people.
The poster is not even up yet!
Oh, the dentist is so painful!
It probably won't hurt at all.
Wow, it's really getting dark early these days.
Why won't you tell me?
And the ultimate superhero needs a really cool costume and lots of gadgets!
Do you have a bottle of water by any chance?
Take a look at this photo.
The roller coaster is really scary.
Think about something else.
...Come in a bit more, Marc.
I feel happy and relaxed.
It was a great New Year's break.
The mallet looks very heavy.
Did you do some extra reading about American history?
It looks just like him!
Yuki Onna, "Bancho Sarayashiki", what else?
Yes, that's the one.
Her husband is very unkind to her.
Then Oiwa becomes a ghost and takes revenge.
What do you usually eat on Halloween?
In the drawer to your right.
No, no, that's the sugar container!
Now I get it!
Becky, what are the products of photosynthesis?
I will give a retest for students with scores under 65.
Oh, why is science so hard?
Oh yes, the Christmas concert is in a month.
As you know, the concert is in four weeks.
Well, I have some big news.
But it's a secret.
I won't tell anyone, I promise!
What is your image of the ultimate superhero?
There's flying, there's superhuman strength, there's special vision...
It is kind of sudden news.
Don't you have a scarf, Shun?
That gives me an idea... .
Who is it for?
I am attaching a picture of my friends and me.
What should we do?
The year went by so quickly.
I was on the phone.
It's warm in Miami all year round, right?
It was very relaxing.
First, chop up a chocolate bar.
So, he got bad teeth.
It's a brand new model!
I know that for sure!
My mother is here on vacation.
Why don't you try it?
Leave it to me!
Can I have some rice, too?
Thank you for your New Year's card.
Thank you for your card, too.
The mallet wasn't so heavy.
But working well with a partner was hard.
One person pounds the rice.
Then another person turns the rice over.
Yes, timing is really important.
This fresh omochi is so delicious!
Yes, it was great.
New Year's is always wonderful.
What was the best thing about it?
Oh, Miki, you know the answer!
The otoshidama was the best thing!
Now I have lots of money!
I can buy Wild Joe Morton's new CD!
Are your parents here?
They are coming in a little while.
But they are still cleaning the house!
Can you believe it?
They love the year-end cleaning and they just can't stop!
Thank you for the beautiful bracelet.
I'm wearing it now.
Oh, it looks pretty on you.
You were very quiet...
Oh, I was just shy.
But I was happy.
Oh, lots of cookbooks!
What are you going to make?
Yes, I'm getting ready for it every day.
Each class is going to divide into groups.
Hey, this sounds like fun!
That jack-o'-lantern is great!
That jack-o'-lantern gives me an idea!
Children like scary movies!
Don't forget "Yotsuya Kaidan".
What a scary movie!
I know "Bancho Sarayashiki".
Do you know "Yotsuya Kaidan?"
What happens in it?
Yotsuya Kaidan sounds very interesting.
Maybe in the 1700s, I think.
Do you like modern horror movies, too?
When it comes to scary movies, I'm an old-fashioned girl.
Your special movie program is a great idea!
Many people think so.
Ben, Yoko, and Shun are all excited about it!
I have an idea.
You can have a Halloween party with your friends here!
Wild Joe Morton has a special Halloween message on his website!
It says, 'Hello, ghosts and witches, bats and black cats!
Do you like my new album "Rockin' Halloween"?
Have a rocking Halloween!'
But I like this pumpkin cookie recipe.
The cookies are ready!
Over there in that plastic container.
But Okiku should just face reality and move on!
YOU break all the dishes.
Then you can't count anything.
Yes, the right side shows the products.
The products are a carbohydrate and oxygen.
We have a test on photosynthesis next week.
Oh, good luck with your studying, then.
My friend Anna is visiting Japan now.
Mom, please tell me more at dinner tonight!
How do you like shichi-go-san, Anna?
It is a special red and white candy for shichi-go-san.
It means "thousand-year-candy" and it brings long life.
I have your tests.
I really need practice.
I'm leaving early today.
Are you superfine today?
It will be at Memorial Music Hall.
We'll go by bus from the school.
Does anyone else have a question?
Then let's start on the first piece.
What are you doing this weekend, Miki?
Can you tell us your big secret yet?
Mom, you won't believe this!
Ben is going back to the U.S. at the end of March.
Oh, that's a shame.
You two are such good friends.
His father is going to work at a hospital in Boston.
Now that's very interesting... .
It's getting really cold.
Oh, I really need a scarf!
Yes, there really isn't much time.
By the way, what are you knitting, Becky?
It is a secret.
My lips are sealed!
Shun and Ben are over there!
They are in the same row.
Oh yes, I see them.
Becky and Yoko, are you ready?
The concert is starting!
Yes, we're ready, Mr. Superfine!
Thank you for the beautiful necklace.
I am wearing it right now.
He is wearing a blue scarf.
There is a story behind it.
Someday I'll tell you!
Also, there is a man with a camera in the background.
That is Mr. X!
There is something very mysterious about him...
I'll find out his identity.
Then I'll tell you that, too!
Just don't stay out too late.
It's about 20 degrees below zero.
You're curious about the mystery message, right?
He sounds so desperate!
What's wrong with that?
So it's not just a toolbox, but a treasure.
It's only a few minutes.
But we weren't in time for the sunrise.
You're going to be famous.
Congratulations on your TV debut.
Ladies, dinner is ready!
Get off at Midori Station.
Enjoy your winter break!
That's a little expensive for me.
Why don't you try your luck this year?
It was so much fun.
I'm interested in skiing.
I trained hard for the part.
When does the show start?
That's a terrible cough.
Do you have a sore throat?
Next, let's check your heartbeat.
How can I help you?
Do you have any interesting stories?
How does the cat steal your fish?
It comes out of nowhere.
You can eat the chocolates, but brush your teeth afterwards.
Let's go to the haunted house.
The view is great!
Take a deep breath and look!
We're right behind you!
It looks like mine, but it's not.
They always stand by my side, in good times and bad.
I put my heart and soul into this.
How about you guys?
And I chose a photo for the contest.
After this speech, it's your turn.
But now I'm satisfied.
I was so moved.
He is famous in our school.
Yes, this stage is unique.
You can get a great view from here!
I have a trip with the shodo club.
Then, let's try again.
Here are the relay members―Kyle, Hayato, Eric and Sho.
Go for it, Takumi!
I can really count on you.
Your students are very professional!
You look happy and relaxed.
It's my turn for mochitsuki!
Are they working today?
It was really nice of you.
Well, I love my scarf, too!
Hey, there's Mr. X!
Oh, he's looking right at me!
Did he look angry?
Hey, be careful, Jimmy!
It was an accident!
He probably doesn't really feel "happiness in" with beans!
Oh, I'm thinking about Valentine's Day.
They were really delicious!
Well, thank you for saying so.
But this year I want something different.
I want something exciting and romantic!
This is for you.
There are truffles inside.
You can make truffles?
Next Monday is a holiday in America.
Does anyone know why?
Umm... well, no, I didn't.
American students are lucky.
They get a holiday next week.
Shun, did you forget already?
Well, I kind of forgot.
February 11 was a long time ago.
Well, next month we have Vernal Equinox Day.
In 50 minutes we have recess again!
Pretty soon it will be the Asagaya Marathon.
How are you feeling?
What did he say?
OK, everyone, listen up!
Do you know anything about this?
No, I have no idea.
Each group will make a short film about the school.
Yoko and I are the directors of a film about the brass band.
Shun and I are doing a film about the baseball team.
Oh, there's Yoko with the camera!
Well, we got some good shots of the band practice.
But editing it was a little tricky.
But we got some good interviews with the team members.
Oh, here is the principal, Ms. Iguchi.
Oiwa is the main character.
In every age people enjoy the thrill of a scary story.
Oh, it smells wonderful!
Anyway, let's imagine a different story.
Wow, you have a lot of papers on the table.
Wow, you are like a professional guide, Jimmy!
Patience is a virtue, you know.
Well, I have a scarf but I can't find it anywhere.
Is it a scarf?
I'll get in touch with Misa and Kenta right away!
What is life without a little mystery?
It's very confusing for me!
Well... Karinto is so-so.
Where is our meeting place?
Luckily I have a cell phone in case of confusion.
Finally, my forgetfulness is useful!
Oh, this is such fun!
Call me every now and then, OK?
Oh my, how can I take Kotaro's call?
Will he run out of the room?
Let's work on it together, Mai!
Maybe Kotaro knows his big sister very well!
Let's get on the train.
Did anything catch your eye?
They are so competitive!
Oh my, that sounds rather mysterious!
Nice to meet you, too.
No, I'm not tired but I am ready for a nice, hot bath at home!
No problem, I'm not in a hurry.
Yes, it's "Rain on My Heart".
You have a big family.
How much is admission?
Yeah, I suffer from "just-in-case" syndrome, too!
Peter has a crush on you!
... He isn't here now.
This house is vacant now.
You sure are earth-friendly!
Taro, you'll make it to the finals!
Into the deep blue sea.
Peek-a-boo turned over the Voice's sign.
Would you like some coffee?
Ma'am, aren't my hamburgers ready yet?
I ordered pizza, just in case.
That's your first clue for this month!
I can tell the culprit from the tiny teeth marks!
Do you know the culprit already?
Let's go and catch the culprit red-handed!
History is my favorite subject!
He eats an afternoon snack.
I'm so glad to see you again!
She's up for it!
Everyone is already here.
Naram will tell me about it later anyway!
Rewind the tape a little, Yume.
But it's just around the corner!
I'm at a station.
Why is your dress yellow?
I'm in a hurry!
Don't worry about it.
Tomorrow is another day!
About this size, maybe...
Would you like something to drink?
It was just like this canoe.
It says, "I'm busy."
He's watching a basketball game on TV!
Hang in there, Finfy!
We're deep enough, Grandpa.
I only see coral.
So the power is doubled?
Look up "tandem bike" on the Internet!
It has two pairs of pedals.
You told me about that tandem bike.
So we can connect it to a propeller!
So, how was your day?
And you read books on bugs, right?
One day, she passed out at work....
I believe in him.
Nature is my life.
How are you, Mr. Stone?
Hand me a piece of paper.
I had a soccer game, and I scored my first goal.
I still have a chance.
Let's go and get my dad.
Do you want anything else?
We are excited about this dinner.
How can I forget?
Good luck in America!
Your bento is beautiful as always, Ron.
Can I have your autograph now?
Eva is looking for a good location in LA.
She's following her dream, and I'm following her.
We are going to open stores all over the world.
It's a message from Dad.
She is in the soccer club.
Ah, it's a famous fairy tale.
I have soccer practice.
They talk a lot.
Dad's commercial is on the air tonight.
The sunset from Mt. Kazahana is beautiful.
When do you have soccer practice?
How many stops before Midori Station?
It doesn't stop at Midori Station.
It's Mr. Sakaki's special Japanese sweet.
Let's shoot it together.
It was in my bag with my other things!
How about in the fridge?
Saya, look at the stitching on your uniform!
What does it say?
Thank you for your card.
It's cold here, but we are doing great.
That's a nice card.
It says, "I want a lot of cake and chicken for Christmas."
I want my own restaurant in LA someday.
I recommend this pair.
Oh, but it's a good bargain!
Are you buying a fukubukuro?
How was your winter break?
Well, you don't like sports.
Takumi is only good at winter sports.
I practiced with my dad.
Can you teach me how?
You are a good surfer, so maybe you can snowboard well.
I stayed at home.
Are you sleepy, Lisa?
I got up at four a.m.
I was practicing my lines for a TV series.
Are you doing a TV series now?
The title is The Figure Skating Detective.
Wow, that's hard work!
Actually, it started two weeks ago.
Leonardo is in the show.
How is his acting?
You look pale, too.
Did you see a doctor?
I know a good clinic!
And I have a bad cough.
What is it, doctor?
What's wrong with me?
It's just a cold.
Oh, I don't like powdered medicine.
Do you have tablets?
You can take it with that jelly!
Oh, that's a good idea.
We are reporters from the MAA school newspaper.
Well, we have a cat problem.
A cat steals our fresh fish!
It takes an expensive fish, and then it disappears.
Wow, the cat is a real phantom thief!
Run after it, Kyle!
Oh, it's a house cat!
Is it a lost cat?
Now the cat can go home.
Oh, you bought so much.
We also bought marshmallows.
Look, these are star-shaped and heart-shaped.
And he didn't brush his teeth well.
Now, back to our chocolate!
Dip the marshmallows in the chocolate.
Put them in the fridge, and that's all!
Ms. Miller taught us how.
Let's ride the roller coaster next.
Then, how about this?
I go with Kyle, and you go with Takumi.
Open your eyes, Hina.
What's my favorite food?
Do they write their own music and lyrics?
And here's a message from you, "Go for it!"
Anyway, let's find the owner of the notebook first!
Is this yours, Hina?
So, the secrets are about acting.
I'll take the notebook to Kyle.
So, what's in your notebook, Marc?
I passed the audition!
I played many different parts.
I got one of the main parts.
I finished my shodo piece for the exhibition.
Now it's time for the final performance.
You really touched my heart.
Yes, I'm a big fan of Asada Farm.
It was all thanks to my friends!
Nice to meet you!
Hi, I'm Kyle Johnson.
It's in the U.S.
Oh, that's a nice camera!
Please call me Sophy.
You two are friends?
We are from Hokkaido!
My room number is five-o-three, too.
I have an alarm clock!
Welcome to Marina Art Academy!
I am your Academy Master, Saionji Joe.
Who is Prince Leo?
I'm your homeroom teacher, Cathy Isabella Bell.
I like music, carnivals and samba!
Thank you for the handkerchief, Hina!
Thanks for the parcel, Dad!
It's nice and tidy.
But I see something....
Are you okay, Marc?
What is this room?
I like her voice.
What is the song?
Music is my passion.
This is 70 percent off!
Can I help you?
Can I carry your bag?
Marc, Ayame, how about some chocolate?
Marc, go to the dentist.
That's a good boy!
Look at this email, Hina.
The entrance ceremony, dormitory... so many pictures!
But we don't have any good pictures together.
You can try it.
Please take a look.
Marina Theater... is this?
You're here too, Ms. Bell!
Hina, play with me!
Here, look at this.
Wow, it looks different from the sea.
Do you like it?
Here, use this fan.
My flight is in two weeks.
Do you make any homemade sweets?
What are your plans for the summer?
You can have all three.
Can I call you back?
He makes snacks for you?
We also make jam at Asada Farm.
Let's have a jam party!
Actually, I agree with you.
Anyone can try out.
Maybe we can use Mr. Saionji's vacation house for the next trip.
Today's dinner is curry and rice.
Here are some photos from last year.
He is a great sprinter.
Let's get ready for the relay.
Our class is in the lead.
This is a close race!
Today, let's make it with bonito flakes.
The audition starts in ten minutes.
Why are you here?
It's time for the audition!
You're my rival, Lisa, but you're my friend.
Lisa is the winner of the audition.
Let's take a look.
Let's have a closer look.
How do you know that?
This is so much fun!
This dog is so faithful.
It was a long time ago.
What does it say?
Those were the good old days....
Just a moment, please.
You're so bad at card games!
I don't want to say goodbye!
I don't want a bedtime story tonight.
I'm going to call Miki and tell her all about the trip.
I didn't know that!
Yes, it is Washington's Birthday.
Of course I ran.
I'm feeling a little better.
He said "Next time don't run in the rain in February!"
She is going to introduce the famous documentary filmmaker!
My lips are sealed!
When was the onset of his symptoms?
But this morning he complained of a headache and a sore throat.
Kotaro, get lots of water and get lots of rest.
Kotaro, are those your pajamas?
Well, Kotaro is a growing boy with a lot of energy.
What is that in your bag, Kotaro?
Well, maybe I did.
Oh, just forget about it, OK?
Did you get down on one knee?
Ms. X, of course!
There she is... hey, wait a minute!
Where did she go?
That's the way with Ms. X.
She always remains a mystery!
I especially like the five musicians.
I didn't mean it that way!
There is a superstition....
Thank you so much for coming.
It's a lot of fun!
This is my first time on a water bus.
Well, OK, I'm often forgetful.
Sanja Matsuri is a very old festival.
Mai and Kotaro, the fish and salad are delicious!
Mr. Freethrow is tough, too.
Oh, the rainy season!
Well, it's a little confusing sometimes, but basically, yeah.
Do you want some help with math?
Any time after 5:00 is fine.
Here's the first question.
You move the minus sign.
The Ueki-ichi is amazing!
Well, maybe sometimes, but this one is really big!
Yes, this one in Asakusa is famous in Japan.
Every day I memorize the English name for a new plant.
They are in the closet in the back room.
You are pretty tall, Kotaro.
I'm about 155 centimeters.
And I still love you!
What is it like?
The Soran-bushi is right after the tug of war.
I can ask Tom for help.
The CD is probably about 2,400 yen.
Let's each put in 800 yen now.
Yes, I would love to.
Yes, it's very beautiful.
Oh, you should ask my sister.
OK, let's head in that direction.
I almost can't bear it!
That's fine with me.
Hey, it's the catalog from the art exhibition in Ueno!
How does she always turn up like that?
She is really a mystery....
I can't find Kotaro.
Kotaro really loves his new camera!
Why is she wearing a kimono, too?
She is learning the tea ceremony.
I can't go out in front of a big audience!
Plays are so much fun!
No, I'm not teasing you.
Mai is looking at the handprints.
The people sing songs and ask for lodging.
Wish me luck with the paper!
You are very diligent, Mai.
Kotaro, Tom and I are just good friends.
In your computer there are many, many photos of Tom.
These days Kotaro says the same thing all the time.
I'm feeling a little thirsty and tired.
But the essence is still the same.
Nothing can beat the onsen!
She graduated from university in three and a half years.
Sarah visited Tokyo once before.
We're happy to see you!
And now it is probably time for lunch.
But the trains run every 12 minutes.
Oh, that big sumo wrestler is blocking her!
I already started training last week.
Every day they compare their distances and times.
It will be fun!
Oh, you're getting in shape for the school marathon, too!
Oh, Junta, I'm curious, but eavesdropping is wrong...
I just overheard their conversation!
Well, unfortunately, nothing important.
And I'm hungry now!
You're always thinking about food.
That restaurant over there looks good.
He's interested in Japanese food.
Well, maybe just a little bit!
This message is valuable advice for everyone.
Oh, I definitely think so.
It is an honor, sir.
Sit here, Mr. Riddle!
Nice to meet you.
This is my dog Holmes.
Nice to meet you, too.
How are you today?
I'm fine, too, thank you.
It is a great museum about traditional Japan.
This is my sister Alice.
Your name is nice too, Shin.
The museum is big!
It is my favorite, too.
I'm ready for a break!
He is deep in thought...
Is this our stop?
It is the next one.
He is over there!
O-dango is in his left hand and a camera is in his right hand!
June is not a good time for outdoor sports.
But I prefer music.
Actually, Maki and I get along well.
Yes, they live in Sapporo.
It is a leaf with a small red berry on it.
The train and subway system in Tokyo is very convenient!
Is this order for here or to go?
9,000 minus 2,700 is... 6,300 yen.
Here is your change.
Actually, Junta and Alice are not bad dancers.
What do you remember?
I see a familiar face!
What is a good present for them?
Let's see... how do we get there?
Hmm... the elevators are over there.
Sometimes in the summer we look at the stars together.
I'm a little tired.
Where is the exit?
But people print lots of things just in case.
"Hand-me-downs have special memories".
It's a souvenir from our honeymoon in Paris.
Oh, the lights are dimming!
Well... it's a mixture of a few things.
These are the ingredients.
Yes, we have various cans and bottles of drinks.
Hey, why don't you come over for a cup of tea?
OK, lead the way!
Everyone needs more focus on the total sound.
I don't see why not.
I don't want to eat.
Please come and see them.
Let's grow them together!
She did it to herself!
You are too good to your parents...
Taro, I'll see you off at the airport.
Then, good luck, Taro.
Good luck to you, too, Doc and Tomomi.
Otherwise, it will break the machine.
I don't ever want to see his face again.
Tomomi, I finally found you!
Why are you here?
Let's go to bed!
You all look so strong.
I'm always the guinea pig!
Why are you here?
This is a lie detector.
Do you want to try it?
I don't want to.
They're your history, Doc!
I love your music.
Does she play well?
As many as you like.
You will definitely win!
Whoops, I did it again.
OK, here you are.
Isn't Dad coming home tonight?
You have a talent for making "Cs".
My beard style is already a "U".
He is my grandpa.
OK, let's go out and have dinner at the dosukoi restaurant.
Are you asking, "What are you doing?"
I am getting old.
Bring in the zoni!
We eat zoni for three days!
May I ask your names?
Well... in short... we're travelers.
He wasn't born yet, but history says...
Can you dance on a full stomach, Aradon?
There's a good Japanese restaurant nearby.
You look pretty in that red jacket.
We caught five, and that's more than enough for dinner.
Just a second, please.
I don't want to leave!
Where is the restroom?
I hear Imo now!
My friend is missing!
How did you know that?
Sorry, I have a cold.
Pour the curry over rice.
I hope you get well soon!
She got a bite, and caught a very strange fish.
What does it mean?
Our work is done, Aradon!
I'm back in Japan with my brother and parents!
The Voice from the sky!
That will take us one whole year!
They are everywhere in Tokyo.
Let's go to Edo Castle in 1742!
You can't go today.
How about at eight, then?
I'm not a baby!
She's nine years old.
You can go in now.
Now you can go in.
So, where is the second letter?
What's the second letter?
I'll find your parents!
How do we get there?
Nice to meet you!
Ummm... can I take a picture with you?
Let me try them.
Don't go over that wall!
That brave dinosaur just looked at me and smiled!
Turn off the alarm clock!
Three plates of fried eggs....
What a big sword!
Yes, but he's going to kill us with it!!!
The Voice from the sky is a good friend.
Do you like grapes?
You live in a beautiful palace, Queen Cleopatra.
I'm on vacation with Caesar.
I can't go in there.
It's about 150 meters tall.
So, it's not an ancient map.
So our next goal is China?
How old was he?
The old man had a very long and hard life.
All his sorrow was in his beard.
We start English lessons in the first year of elementary school.
What's that on the desk?
That's the manual for our next space mission.
The space food is in packages.
What did the answering machine say?
I'll call back soon, but here's your hint.
How many letters do we have?
Are you going to the ceremony?
It's only a mile from here.
The speech starts at three or so?
We still have a lot of time.
Don't forget about the next secret letter!
You can send your voice to a place far away!
What a creative girl!
You look a bit pale.
I know a good place!
Oh, I need a pair of pajamas, too!
You made a wrong turn.
You're a genius, but you don't know!
How big was the peach?
Look after this cute little girl!
How old are you?
Read me this book!
Get on my back!
"She wore a yellow ribbon..."
We have a lot of clues!
Don't worry about me!
Did you find the next clue?
Honey is sleeping on the couch.
At least she's quiet now!
You have an idea?
I'm naming it "Mystery V"!
Leave me alone, Keiji!
Why do you say that?
She bought five kilograms of cocoa beans last Thursday.
So we solved the mystery all by ourselves?
Please be seated on that sofa.
Make yourselves at home.
I, Ro, Ha, Ni, Ho, He, To... Se, Su, N!
I didn't know that!
You're a genius, Grandpa!
Interpol wanted to recruit me 60 years ago.
Not to mention Eita and Niho's pet, Mose!
You'll all be great detectives someday!
What an easy question!
My dad's car is 15 years old, and tiny!
Money can buy a car, but it can't buy talent as a good detective, Asaki.
Get in the car.
I waited for your reply for a week...
Let me turn on the AC.
Don't worry about it.
I don't like carrots.
Umm... I'm fine, thank you.
Cut it out, Iroha!
Yes, bugs are a lot of trouble...
Ignore her, Mr. Haruno!
Do you like Ms. D?
Kei-kun's screams are so loud.
He screams every night!
Come see us soon!
It starts with "B."
They're everywhere in the summer!
Where does Cousin Keiji sleep now?
But... he never goes to work lately, right?
But "mosquito" has no "B" in it....
What are you talking about?!
These are the culprits!
How did you know?
Why didn't you tell your mom?
H... how can I tell Mother, "I have nightmares of beh... buh..."?
Now I can go back to work as a genius detective!
Here's my bill, Asaki!
How do you know about Naram?!
No, I'm not all right!
Aunt Wakayo's line is busy, Keiji.
It's 3,500 yen for everything.
Do you hear that?
He's so out of tune!
I want to take a bath in the hot spring, too!
How much were they?
Well, it's time for the courage test.
We're on our way.
I don't want to talk to him...
Oh, here it is!
I'm not interested, but what is it?
Would you like to join me for a movie on Sunday?
Would you like to join me for a movie on Sunday?"
Where's the rewind button?
Can I have this little fish?
The door is unlocked!
You don't look like a shadow, Nuru!
There you are, Mr. Asaki!
She's holding a bento box and waving at Niho!
Both of her parents work late, so...
What a great guy!
I-I mean, g-good morning!
We're going to look up the word "delicacy."
What are you up to?
What's going on, Keiji?
I finished them all in one day!
Jealousy is dangerous, Yume!
Let me put it this way:
Ms. Okuyama's best friend is Saki, a teacher at another school.
We're not listening, Keiji.
I'll introduce Saki to Mr. Ui!
Ms. Okuyama will be jealous of her best friend!
Then, Ms. Okuyama will fall in love with Mr.Ui!
This meeting is over!
Here's a note from him.
Get off the train at Asakusa.
It's the last stop.
Why don't you call her?
Put some smoke on your knee.
The lady in the white dress!
You can't miss it!
What's on the menu tonight?
Let's see... page 82?
You eat like a horse, Sakura.
This page is about... carrots... onions... potatoes...
What is it for?
Oh, that's a good trick!
So... the color and the smell of the lemon...
Even with social studies?
Hands on my cheeks....
This bowl has strawberries and kiwis, and this one has ank...
We have pancakes with anko at the café, too!
You're leaving so soon, Daffodil!
I got a transfer to San Francisco.
I have some big news for you!
Thanks for the ride.
Oh, I'll miss her!
It looks just like you!
That is your mother.
"Ant" is "ari" in Japanese!
Get ready for bed.
My name is from Daisy's cherry blossoms?
Eat your breakfast, Sakura.
Hasuo wants two eggs?
Don't be jealous, Sakura.
Her name has a magic letter...?
No wonder Fukuta likes her!
Turn off the light!
Hasuo is so angry!
Don't call me tonight!
Good luck with your tests!
Just forget about it.
How are you, Umeo?
Just five more laps!
Give it all you got, Umeo!
Five more laps, and we can go to your house!
Are you all right?!
I can eat your triangle toast.
She's my blue moon...
That's a stray cat, but she has a name.
You have kindergarten tomorrow.
Momo is here with me.
Don't worry about it, Hasuo!
It's not the season for botan.
The sink is over there!
By the way... what color am I?
You love Hibiscus flowers, right?
You just want fruit!
He's not dangerous, Umeo.
It's like my bed!
Mr. Manju has a girlfriend?!
Do you like it?
Thank you for the other day.
You'll understand tomorrow evening...
She is a gentle and delicate lady.
Do you want something to drink, Sakura?
Don't worry about it, dear!
How much are they?
Is the cheesecake good, Sakura?
Just a glass of orange juice for me, please.
You eat like a horse!
Don't worry about the bill.
But you can help him, Sakura.
You always feel great, right?
What about my project?
We can always take a vacation.
What are greeting cards?
Where do we send them?
Oh, you need a "T" here.
Can I have some tea, please?
I'm on the other side.
Bring that roll of paper from the shelf.
It's an old map.
Not just a map.
It shows the seafloor.
What's this red X?
Jason was a very good sailor, but a typhoon came...
On that day, strong winds...
You can tell us later.
No, tell us now.
Coconuts were his life.
Typhoons didn't scare him.
Do you still remember him?
Grandpa... are you still checking the sub?
We need three big cans of waterproof indigo paint.
Where can I get waterproof paint?
I know St. Marmalade Hospital.
But where is Haggy's?
Mom knows which stop.
She's out shopping with Angel.
Hold on a minute.
Just go there and get the paint, OK?
Can he get the paint?
Oh, Zibby and Angel!
What are you two doing here?
What are YOU doing here?
I'm looking for Haggy's Hardware.
I need some indigo paint for Mech.
The Lucy Two is ready!
It was thirty years ago.
Go with Dolphy and look around.
The red X is over there.
So go about 30 meters north, and then...
I can't hear you!
Hand me the whiteboard, Mech.
I didn't see any boats...
What did the boat look like?
She's going under again.
That's the fifth time.
Did you see anything this time?
Send a message to Milo?
What kind of message?
Oh, a reply from Milo.
What does it say?
What are you doing, guys?
Text him again, Mech!
I got a message!
Do you have a sea chart?
He says, "The current flows east."
Head to the small, pointed island.
Come back to the canoe, Finfy!
The current flows that way, so dive here.
I saw something, but Dolphy scraped his tail!!
So he's swimming slowly!
Call Doctor Medic, Mech.
He can treat him, I think.
Let me see the patient.
Put this pill in a sardine.
Give him two each day.
I'm in charge of the wires.
So... I only pull this oar?
Can you dive and jump?
Can Dolphy kiss Finfy?
Can you kiss me?
Can you hear me, Lolan?
Where IS that "something"?
Isn't that Jason's boat?
The oars are stuck!
Move your right arm!
The oars are heavy!
Have some coconut milk.
Breakfast is important, Mech!
The air is running out.
I can't see you today.
Open the central tank and dump the sand, Grandpa!
Lolan, I heard about your standing dolphin.
By the way, I read a flier yesterday.
Milo is selling a used tandem bicycle.
Nobody needs it on this island!
I can ride behind Oliver!
Oliver isn't here, so I can ride with you!
Lolan, did you give up on the sub?
The riders work together.
Let's go to Milo's!
Why do you need a bike for a sub?
Just wait and see!
You solved our problem.
Can I look at it?
Milo, can you take off the wheels?
And use it as an engine.
Get a wrench from my toolbox.
You need a transmission for that.
Long time no speak!
How was your Sunday?
I'm working on the Lucy Three.
Give me the phone!
I really miss Dolphy...
When can you see him?
What are these strings?
The blue string means... danger?
Yes, and the red string means...?
Get a wrench from my toolbox.
This nut is loose.
It was all my fault.
What do you mean?
We were very poor.
I worked hard on the farm, and Lucy...
She went to Jam City and worked hard, too.
She worked too hard for the family.
That's the last picture of her.
It was a present for me.
Was it this toolbox?
You loved her so much.
And she's still with you.
Now slow down and... stop!
We made it, Grandpa!
Yes, after thirty years.
I can finally say goodbye.
Jason, meet Lucy and my grandson!
I'm happy for you, Grandpa!
What are they doing?
Mech is my best friend.
They pulled the red string!
No, WE did it!
Now let's get back to Pepper Island.
I'm ten years old.
I'm... seventy-three years old.
Coconuts are my life.
That canoe is my life.
My motto is "Let it be."
Thirty-one plus twenty-four is?
A, B, C, D...
And yes, Angel is a genius.
I'm busy with dinner.
It's a Pepper Island lizard.
Open your eyes now.
Let me hear his voice!
You read books and study math.
Get in the water!
What do you want for dinner tonight?
Get that bottle of coconut oil.
Mech, my new book is out!
Can you stay in the woods alone?
You're on break now?
Do you have a sleeping bag?
It looks perfect for you, Oliver!
Get in the canoe, everybody!
Row, row, row your boat...
Now, let's go up this river.
This is the perfect site!
Let's find out about it.
It has no windows.
Just think about it!
Now is our chance!
How can we get in?
Pass me the receipts!
How do we get to Jam City?
What is it, Mo?!
I need help with my hobby.
In a way it is.
No wind... no waves... a half moon....
He has a very good swimming coach.
They're a bit behind the schools in Jam City.
How much is it?
Come to Lolan's house on the double!
I'll miss you, Angel!
Come and see us sometime!
I have some news!
I have good news.
The Lucy One can't sink.
Water only fills the tail and she stands up!
I love both of you, and I love this farm, too!
Please leave a message after the beep.
You can't reach your dad?
Are you scared of your mom?
Well, I'm doing a project and I need a few things...
Go to that counter over there.
That's $47.80 in total.
Hello, are you ready to order?
What do you recommend for starters?
How do you like the shabu-shabu, Alice?
The food was great.
Are you interested in acting?
No, not at all.
It's a beautiful day for laundry.
That's a good sign.
When do you find out about the result?
Hey, your phone is ringing.
Let's go and look.
What shall we do?
Did you get a lot of chocolates on Valentine's Day, Noriaki?
Did it have a card inside?
Take this, Giant Octopus!
What are you good at?
Can I try one more thing?
Let's give another chance to him.
It's a bit boring.
How about "Japan in a Drop"?
But can I record your voice?
Your voice is perfect for the ad.
You can get a lot of soy sauce.
Let's go to the handicrafts area first.
Hey, this is a nice bag.
I made it from old kimonos.
Let's get two of them.
We only have two in red.
I have it in green here.
How much is it?
How was your year here?
Do you remember my first chawan-mushi?
We are very proud of you.
Thank you for the delicious dinner.
You taught the heart of omotenashi to me.
Your matcha pudding was my favorite.
You can serve it at your own restaurant.
But I need more training.
We have a gift for you.
It's a noren for you.
It's the name of my new restaurant.
What a special gift!
I am so grateful.
I love your dashimaki!
The bento tastes great with this view.
By the way, where is Tommy?
Oh, there he is.
Everyone, I have big news.
I passed the final audition of the movie!
The film shoot is going to start in the summer.
Mom, can we visit Hollywood, too?
That sounds like fun.
Let's all go to LA this summer!
We will cook a special menu for the Hollywood star.
I'll sign my autograph on the wall!
Don't do that, Dad!
I'm interviewing Cinderella and the prince today.
What happened after the dance party?
I'm going to open my first store next month.
The prince is helping me.
Your dream came true.
Now I'm studying Chinese, French, Italian, and Japanese.
What is that for?
You both think globally.
Prince, Cinderella has a present for you.
Thank you for a great year, Jake.
Are you going to continue acting in LA?
I don't know yet.
We're going to miss you.
Let's not think about the future.
We have a barbecue tonight.
Nice to meet you, Ron!
Saya, this is for you.
This is dashi-maki tamago.
You are funny, Tommy.
So, Saya, how old are you?
Here is your lunch.
You're a great chef.
So you like Japanese food.
Jake, your lunch is beautiful!
A "Big Long Toast" sandwich!
"Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato."
So your lunch is BLC.
Do you like soccer?
My friend Saya is late.
Let's give a gift to Mom.
You are an actor, so do it for Mom.
We have a present for you.
Wow, Jake, you're a poet!
My restaurant is close.
In Japanese, it's ayame.
Let's practice it together!
What is the story about?
At first he is young, but in the end he is old.
Dad is in a nice suit.
He is a Japanese businessperson in New York.
Where is my script?
Do you want to hang out with us?
Aw, that's so sweet!
Oh, after you, Jake.
That movie was exciting!
I feel so powerful now.
Actually, I really miss my mom.
It's the rainy season, and it's humid.
You all look well.
Jake, who is that?
Is it a sign for foreign customers?
Our customers sometimes go in by mistake.
Do not eat too much wasabi.
Is this a vacuum cleaner?
Don't make a strange sign!
Don't turn on the TV.
You're a very good soccer player.
Now Saya is ready for victory.
The players are all tall.
"Break a leg" means "Good luck."
It's a Japanese folk dance.
Now you're ready, Ron!
Strawberry, lemon or melon?
And fireflies come to the river at night.
This tempura is delicious!
It's the highlight of tsukimi.
My dad can cut vegetables in different shapes.
My dad makes my breakfast, bento and dinner every day.
Yoko is still at work, but please come in.
This green tea smells good.
I'm in Japan for a meeting.
Thank you for a lovely dinner.
He can't make dinner tonight.
So, come over and have dinner at our house.
It's Dad's special curry and rice tonight.
See you in five minutes!
So, do you have any ideas for our play?
Maybe she makes her own dress for the party.
At the end, she starts a fashion brand.
And the prince makes dresses, too!
It's a new happy ending!
Yes, she is a soccer club member.
When is the performance?
Do you have soccer practice?
I'm free on both days.
When is soccer club practice on Saturdays?
It's a letter from your mom.
Dear Jake, Happy Halloween!
This is a gift for you and Saya.
It's a fried egg costume.
And this one is bacon!
My mom makes funny costumes every year.
Thank you for the Halloween gifts, Mom.
Can you try them on?
Your sisters are also in costumes.
Dad, do we have vanilla extract?
First, we beat the eggs.
We need three eggs.
Then, we add some vanilla extract.
Can I taste it?
Vanilla extract smells sweet, but it tastes bitter.
Just a little, please.
I'm at the airport.
Give me a hug.
I have an idea.
Break a leg, kids!
I can make a new dress!
I like your dress.
You can start your own brand.
Do you have the directions to Sakaki, Mom?
Enjoy your day, Eva.
How do I eat this?
Pick up the plate.
First, place the bowl on your left hand.
Then, turn the bowl twice.
Well, it's time for our flight.
Have a safe flight.
The camera is ready.
Take a deep breath, Dad.
I can't find it anywhere.
Let's ask Tommy or Yoko.
I don't think so.
Here's your uniform, Saya.
I was in my bedroom.
I can't watch your game, but I'm always with you.
Jake, I have mail for you.
It's from your mom.
I see one more card in the envelope.
It says, "Dear Little Princess."
Ah, it's for Saya.
I have a Christmas card for you, Saya.
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
Can you read your card?
Dear Eva, Season's Greetings!
Have a Happy New Year!
Saya, this card is from me.
Thank you for your smiles every day.
Hey, what's that card?
Is it for me?
It's for Santa Claus.
Wow, I see snow everywhere!
What is that dome?
It looks like a snow house.
Yes, it's a kamakura.
I feel very relaxed.
The view was beautiful.
Oh, are you interested in Japanese food?
They are very light.
I like those over there!
Yes, they're very popular, too.
That's not fair, Daddy!
You can buy just one pair.
It's ten thousand yen.
Happy New Year, Ms. Bell!
This fukubukuro looks like a good deal.
Open it, Ms. Bell!
Look, two tickets to Okinawa!
What a wonderful otoshidama!
And the manatee tour was great, too!
What's a manatee tour?
You can swim with wild manatees.
They swim very slowly.
My family and Takumi's family went skiing together.
That was an amazing jump.
Of course I can!
How was your break, Sophy?
I made sweets with my mother.
And I watched DVDs with my father.
We all had a lovely break!
Does the detective skate?
Well, all the characters in the show are skaters.
Can you skate, Lisa?
For three months, every day.
You can see me from episode three.
When is it on?
I have a surprise for you!
This is his first time on TV.
The director likes him, too.
You're a good actor, too!
I need more practice!
Are you okay, Marc?
I'm very busy now.
You don't look busy.
Please go to the doctor, now!
Please fill out this form.
I have a cough and a slight fever.
How do you know this clinic, Takumi?
So, who's the patient?
Are you a doctor?
Here is your medicine.
Hey Takumi, I found it!
Look, it has a collar.
What shall we do?
I have a good idea!
Do you have any information on this cat?
I know that cat.
And no more worries for the fish store.
It's a happy ending for everyone!
We bought bitter, milk, white... all kinds!
Let's make chocolate marshmallows.
Next, melt the chocolate.
Did he like them?
But it became a nightmare!
He got a toothache!
And... take this, too.
To the haunted house?
This is the operating room.
What are you doing?
But this is fun!
Mr. Ghost, where are you?
No more ghosts for me.
How about one last ride, on the Ferris wheel?
We can see the beautiful sunset over Marina Bay.
What's this for, Ms. Bell
It's a great honor, you know.
The participants sing their original songs in the audition.
You can always try.
By the way, Lisa is entering the audition.
Then I can compete with her again!
The audition is in three weeks.
Play with me, Sophy.
I'm sorry, I can't.
We have an exhibition soon.
Hina is busy, too.
She's writing her song at the library.
Why don't you ask Kyle or Takumi?
I'm going to practice my lines today.
Yeah, I'm almost ready!
I'm going to enter a photo contest.
My favorite photographer is the judge.
Today I'm going to take many pictures.
That's a great thing!
Now I have a plan.
I'm working on it.
Do you see a name on it?
Marc, do you have any idea?
What's wrong with you?
You have a secret notebook?
No, it's not mine.
He writes his acting notes in it.
Oh, Ayame's calling me.
Can you help me?
You can't beat me!
I met many people at MAA.
Everyone is important to me.
So I wrote this song for my friends.
Please listen to my song.
Today Hina finds out the results of the audition.
You scared me for a moment, Hina!
For three years, you all did your best.
The singer for this year is Asada Hina!
The stage is all yours!
Hina, I was not happy about the audition results.
You're my rival and a good friend, forever.
I'm so proud of you!
Good to see you again, Mr. and Mrs. Asada.
How do you know that?
Is that true, Hina?
Nice to meet you, too!
Where are you from, Hina?
Nice to meet you, guys!
This is a lovely room!
Oh, it's a great view.
Tomorrow is the entrance ceremony.
Have a nice day, Ms. Bell!
Ms. Bell is so powerful.
Let's go to the cafeteria!
Is this your handkerchief?
Oh yes, it is!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Nakata.
Where is the cafeteria?
The cafeteria is over there.
This school is so big!
Library, Outdoor Stage... and look, MAA Museum!
Our school, of course!
This is the Shodo Club.
You write your name here.
Do you like shodo, too?
Okay, here it is.
Wow, it's a big box!
Thank you very much, Mr....
Marc is my grandpa.
Your cookies are delicious!
My wedding ring is missing.
My ring is here.
Testing, testing, one, two, three.
She is an actor in musicals.
Yes, she is popular in Japan.
This is my teaching style.
You practice so hard.
Is that you, Kyle?
Hina, your singing is brilliant!
So we are rivals.
It's a wonderful breeze!
It's time for lunch!
Let's sit on the grass over there.
We can't go in.
This is a great spot!
Let's get some soda.
Where is Marina Station?
Follow us to the station.
Now I have a headache.
You are not okay!
But I hate dentists.
Don't be scared, Grandpa.
You are not a baby!
We are all well.
They have lovely smiles!
Yes, I love cherry blossoms.
Let's take a picture now!
That's a great idea.
Let's do rock, paper, scissors!
How about you, Takumi?
The show starts in three minutes.
Look inside your pocket, Ayame.
By the way, are you free this Sunday, Hina?
Let's go on a boat trip.
Do you have a boat?
It's my uncle's boat.
Let's go back, Uncle Yosuke.
Oh, he is missing.
You can enjoy bon odori there.
I have chocolate, vanilla and strawberry.
Can you help me?
I'm a little nervous.
Oh, it's a message from Hina.
Look at this photo.
My mom makes many things with mangoes.
This mango jam looks delicious.
Let's all go together sometime next month.
I can't find Mr. Nakata.
Just a moment, please.
Please tell him, "Come to my office.
It's about the Shodo Club trip."
Is that your daughter?
It's Sports Day soon!
Kyle, you are the leader.
You can count on me, Ms. Bell.
Our class is the best.
We have fantastic cheerleaders...
...and a top photographer, too!
You are on the relay team?
Prince Leo is on our relay team.
I'm not good at sports.
Next is the final race, the relay!
Do you need anything?
And Prince Leo is right behind him.
Time to go back to your dorm.
I can get up early!
Listen to my clarinet!
Today's menu is miso soup with potatoes.
Next, make the broth.
For miso soup, the broth is the key.
Our group has four people.
Oh, it smells so good!
Let's go and have something warm.
What a cute fairy!
You can get some from the storeroom.
The fabric store is closed today.
We can ask the police officer over there.
I can see the front gate!
The front gate is closed today.
Excuse me, can we go to the back gate?
I can't sing in the special concert.
You can try next time.
Mr. Nakata needs you.
You can always try again.
I have a new task for you.
We need an editor for the festival handbook.
I can get some samples.
Here is the guest list.
Each page is in different colors.
Many VIPs come to the festival.
The arch looks fantastic!
The balloon decoration is great.
Thanks for your idea, Kyle!
We sell cupcakes every year at the festival.
Look, this cupcake is in rainbow colors!
Just like our arch.
Please enter in a line.
I can play the part.
I can beat up Momotaro!
The hero is Momotaro.
Let's get all the oni!
We are proud of them.
Let's go and see the shodo performance.
The kanji for dream is in the middle.
Can I take some photos?
Do I look okay?
And that ends this year's MAA Festival!
What a fantastic concert!
You need a break.
Oh, it smells good... and it's tasty!
I like it with honey.
Hey, Sophy, can I borrow a red pen?
So, you like macarons?
Let's go to bed, Sophy.
Maybe you can eat more macarons in your dreams!
It's about a faithful dog.
He's still waiting for his master....
You can read the last chapter tomorrow.
Today's special is roast chicken.
I don't eat chicken.
Well... it's a strange story.
Tell me about it, Sophy.
It was Christmas Eve.
I'm in a hurry.
Get on my back.
Why is the room still messy?
Don't read it out loud!
Here is a letter from you.
"You are my rose, my shining star, my everything.
See you at Christmas.
I was so young!
Let's go out for dinner tonight.
Just you and me!
This Santa looks strange.
In Japan, people send New Year's greeting cards.
I can see my family soon!
Shall we check in?
Let's buy some souvenirs first.
Can you mash the sweet potatoes?
Kuri-kinton is for success in business.
And gobo is for long happiness.
Wash this gobo, Joe.
Don't eat all the sweet potatoes, Ayame!
Shall we go to the shrine later?
No more cards for me!!
We can have our date?
I already chose the location!
Let's go see a movie.
See you on Sunday.
So I'm not dreaming!
Actually, I fell on the stairs last week.
You have a cast!
I'm good with my crutches.
So, you're not ready for the test.
I'm not ready yet!
Is this a boy?
She's not his girlfriend!!
I don't like Momo!
My nickname is Cherry!
What color dress do you want today?
Is that a comic book?
Hasuo has tests next month.
No, there weren't many people.
The three of you look relaxed in your yukata.
Let's take a picture!
That onsen was wonderful!
What is that, Mai?
Who is it for?
Come on, you can tell me!
That was a long time ago!
I am a different person now!
Oh... I don't feel good, Mom.
Can I stay home from school today?
This time I'm serious.
Let me feel your forehead.
Oh, you're burning up!
No school for you today!
He has a slight cold.
I'll be ready in five minutes.
I set my alarm clock for 6:00....
Wow, that's a nice camera!
My parents bought it for me for my birthday.
Let's take a picture of the toshiotoko on the balcony!
I'm really looking forward to the school marathon.
Kenta is practicing really hard.
He's a good runner.
I have a good feeling about his success this year....
But his clothes were really dirty.
Did he roll around in the mud?
I was just the same!
After all your questions to me?
I didn't tell Risa and I'm not telling anyone!
OK, OK, I get the point!
Oh, Valentine's Day is tiring!
You watch too much TV!
Well, what did you do?
I looked into her eyes and asked for her hand in marriage.
Luckily she said yes!
We went to a fancy restaurant that evening.
But I didn't eat anything.
When did you propose?
I proposed at dessert.
Your mother said yes and we ate some chocolate mousse.
What is the Edo Nagashibina Festival?
Oh, it's a really fun festival.
People throw floating dolls into the Sumida River.
The custom of Nagashibina began many centuries ago.
The dolls are so beautiful!
It is very old.
Grandma is not so old.
This is really elaborate!
About a month or so?
We'll put away the dolls very soon.
What kind of superstition?
Here, try some arare!
Oh, that's so soon!
Let's have one last outing with everybody!
How about one last visit to Ueno Park?
She's coming toward us!
Welcome to my exhibition!
Yes, I'm a painter.
I saw you all many times but we never actually met.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
This is my cat Tama.
Nice to meet you, too.
How are you today?
I'm fine, thank you.
I'm fine, too, thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Superfine!
Mai, this is Kenta.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too, Kenta.
I am on the basketball team.
Tom is on the basketball team, too.
The Japanese drum club?
Traditional Japanese culture is so interesting!
Yes, and the trip by water bus is nice.
The garden is really nice, too.
Yes, it's the perfect place for Tom!
Oh, good morning, Kay!
You're up early, too.
Yes, Taro and I are very busy on Children's Day.
It's a short trip by water bus.
That's the Kokugikan over there!
Yes, and that's Nakajima Teahouse.
Yes, and that's our next stop!
No, I'm not OK.
My math textbook isn't in my bag!
You're not always forgetful, Tom.
Isn't that your sports bag over there?
Yes, this is our pride and joy.
This is so exciting!
This is the binzasara no mai.
Maybe it's my favorite, too.
But everything is amazing!
Yes, cooking is fun!
Is this your parents' bookstore?
Yup, this is our bookstore.
Is she your sister?
No, that's my cousin Shoko.
She's a university student.
These are some early cherries from Mr. Shimizu.
Oh, that's very nice of him.
Mrs. Shimizu is from Yamagata.
Oh, cherries are so delicious!
Oh, Ms. Slamdunk is a tough coach!
Well, my report for Mr. Superfine's class.
But first, a nice, hot bath!
And what is that in her hand?
She's beautiful and mysterious.
Oh, you have a dryer?
Oh no, a puddle!
My socks and shoes are all wet!
Oh, Mai, come in, come in!
Oh, those are beautiful roses!
They are for your mother.
Today is a special day for us.
Today is your wedding anniversary!
Oh darling, thank you for the earrings!
Happy anniversary, Mom and Dad!
To all our happy years together!
But you need a strong rhythm.
Now I get it!
You look cool, Mai!
No, we practice on Mondays and Wednesdays.
Wadaiko is hard work, too.
My arms are tired!
Oh, we have another math test next Tuesday!
Oh, Tom, yes, thank you!
Umm... Oh, I don't know!
(-18) ÷9 and –(18÷9) are the same.
I don't go every year, but I go most years.
More than 350 plant shops!
Let's get a snack!
I'm not hungry but I'm thirsty.
OK, a snack for me and a drink for you.
Let's go to that store over there.
It is my favorite drink.
And don't you love karinto?
It's my favorite snack.
I like yokan better.
Oh, I like yokan, too!
I want this plant.
It is so pretty with little red flowers.
Yes, that is really pretty.
This dark green one is the plant for me!
It's our mystery woman!
Yes, I see her!
I don't believe it!
Ms. X, who are you?
It is a very romantic festival.
Two stars, Vega and Altair, are in love.
But they only meet once a year, on the evening of this day.
Wow, that is romantic!
No, of course not!
It's "Chinese lantern plant".
Where do you get your energy?
Another name for this fair is Shimanrokusennichi.
That's a long name!
Oh, I get it!
But why 46,000 days?
They are with the boxes of Christmas decorations.
Where do we keep the boxes of Christmas decorations?
I'm about 150 centimeters.
My yukata from last year is short now!
Everything of mine from last year is short now!
We watch them from different places different years.
This year my parents have a reservation for a yakatabune.
That is the best place for fireworks!
Please join us, Kenta!
It's time for the Sumida River fireworks once again.
Every year we see the fireworks.
This is probably our fiftieth time at least!
But we still love them.
Asakusa is always very crowded on the evening of the Sumida River fireworks.
Cell phones often don't work in big crowds!
Just stick close to me!
The fireworks are beautiful!
Your yukata is very pretty, too, Misa.
What is the Soran-bushi?
It's a Japanese folk dance.
Oh, come to our practice!
What about the Kiba-sen?
Well, four people are one group.
One person is on top and three people are under him or her.
The top person must get the caps of other people on top.
In the Kiba-sen balance and speed are important.
How do we decide the group's movement?
Let's give it a try!
When do we perform the dance?
I am in the tug of war, too.
We must get the music ready.
Thank you, Mr. Superfine!
A real surprise is best.
He and Mai are very good friends.
Very good friends... or in the future something more perhaps?
Can you make a list of Mai's close friends, Tom?
But I can ask Misa, too.
And remember - not a word to Mai about this!
My lips are sealed!
Short and simple, that's the way.
You and Mai see my jacket and walk in.
Then we jump out and say "Surprise!"
The jacket is the key to the plan.
Well, your forgetfulness is also key!
Her favorite musician is Jason Redberry.
That's a good idea.
I can buy it tomorrow.
Do I have 800 yen now...?
You can pay me now or later.
Either way is fine.
Oh, what a lovely card!
Thank you, Mrs. Tatsumi.
And now we should all get into our hiding places.
Let's hide behind the counter!
This is a surprise!
Oh, thank you, everyone!
Ms. X is over there!
Well, she is kind of an important person....
What is that statue?
That's Saigo Takamori, the hero of Satsuma.
Oh yes, I know him a little.
The last samurai, wow!
I like this statue.
Look at this painting!
Oh, the painter is Jean Dubuffet.
Modern art is so fascinating!
I like this style of art.
Claude Monet's "Water Lilies".
So you do like art, Kenta!
This building is interesting.
It's an example of architecture by Le Corbusier.
Who is Le Corbusier?
He's... well, you know, he's....
Let's see... how do we get there?
We go straight from the main entrance and then to the right.
No, it comes before it.
At least, I think so....
We're near some monkeys now....
Are we already past the "Bear Hill"?
Oh, the "Bear Hill" is over there!
Oh, it's so exciting.
I don't think so.
In that case, take mine.
This is from Mom.
I have Mai's phone!
How can I call her?
Hey, it's almost Halloween!
Well, Japan doesn't have a Halloween tradition.
But in recent years many people enjoy Halloween costume parties.
A Halloween costume party....
Hey, let's do that!
Well, where can we have the party?
The back room of my father's bookstore is pretty big.
The back room of an old bookstore!
That is a great place for a Halloween party.
Let me check with my father.
It should be OK.
My idea for a costume is Saigo Takamori.
But where can I get some old Japanese clothes?
That's a great idea!
But he doesn't own a sword.
How about 7:00 for the party?
The bookstore doesn't close until 6:00 anyway.
But is it really OK with your father?
He doesn't mind a bit.
In fact, he's excited about the party.
He may wear a costume, too.
Don't step on my tail!
What is your costume anyway?
Your costume is good but it needs something....
That's a great idea, Mai!
Tom is Saigo Takamori.
The statue shows Saigo-san with a dog.
So Tom has a dog, too.
But Kay, Tom's dog is a poodle!
Misa, your costume is fantastic!
But one of my ears is loose.
Can you fix it for me?
I see a hook here.
It hooks behind my ear.
What a fun party!
It's Ms. X again!
Children grow up so fast....
Yes, my friend Takeshi's daughter Mio is already three.
Now it's her turn for Shichi-go-san!
Speak of the devil!
Little girls in kimono are so cute.
That is chitose-ame, a kind of candy stick.
Chitose means 1,000 years.
It's a symbol of a long life.
That's a very long life!
That's Shoko, Kenta's cousin.
Oh, kimonos are so fantastic!
Dad, I need your help!
But you know the saying: The show must go on!
I can't do this.
But you can do this.
You're a great actress.
Please tell Mr. Showtime for me.
We need you, Mai.
I'm not taking no for an answer!
I love the thrill of a live performance!
Well, Mai, you're back to your usual self again.
Well, maybe I'm teasing you just a little....
Misa, look over here!
It's Mifune Toshiro's handprint!
And here is Ueki Hitoshi's!
Are Tom and Mai looking at the handprints, too?
Tom is looking at Mai.
Thank you for inviting me, Mr. and Mrs. Tatsumi.
It's our pleasure, Tom.
That will be a big help.
The title is "Manju Kowai".
It's about a boy and his fear of manju....
The boy goes to sleep and the other boys put lots of manju around him.
Then he wakes up....
He eats the manju with delight!
So he actually likes manju.
He's a sly boy!
You have to write a paper about Christmas celebrations throughout the world.
Can we work on it with other classmates?
Yes, you may do your research together.
In Mexico, people walk from home to home from December 16th.
On Christmas Eve, everyone is welcome, and there is a big Christmas party.
Father Christmas and St. Nicholas are some of them.
How many names does Santa Claus have?
And a good question deserves a good answer.
But... I'm not sure.
We have a lot of interesting information.
Now we must write our actual papers.
Oh, I'm not good at writing!
Tom is really good at basketball.
He is great at shooting baskets, dribbling, passing....
You are always talking about Tom these days.
I'm not always talking about him!
Just maybe the answer is yes!
Yes, I have a lot of photos of Tom!
That is just a coincidence!
Little brothers are so annoying!
He is imagining a romantic relationship between Tom and me!
Misa, are you on his side?
You love Grandma very much.
Your grandmother and I are still in love after 50 years.
What is true love?
How can you know for sure?
Just listen carefully to your heart.
Kenta, is there something wrong?
Oh, no, there's nothing wrong.
The face on that racket looks just like you!
Hey, yeah, you're right!
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Shall we look for a vending machine and a bench?
Oh, there are many people on the benches already....
Those people are getting up.
Thank you for the bear!
"Little Tom" is sitting on top of it.
There isn't much space on the bookstand but he looks happy.
P.S. How will Ms. X spend the New Year's holidays?
What do you think?
Kyosuke was just a little boy.
Everything is more modern now.
Mountains and lots of snow!
We love this place!
There you are, Grandpa and Grandma!
We're a little late - sorry!
Yes, a little bit.
By the way, how was the onsen?
How about you, Miki?
Not really, but you're right -it's cool!
I like our initials!
We don't need your input, thank you very much!
She's coming to Japan!
But doesn't she have classes?
Oh, she sounds great!
I'm looking forward to meeting her!
Her name is Sarah.
She's really interested in Japanese art.
Let's show her all around!
This time, she's interested in visiting Kamakura.
Kamakura, here we come!
This is my sister Sarah.
Hi, Sarah, I'm Shin.
How was your flight?
It wasn't too bad.
I listened to music, watched a movie, and napped a bit.
Well, welcome to Japan!
I printed a map of Kamakura for you.
This is really useful.
Our teacher showed some slides of beautiful Buddhist statues to us.
And now I can see them with my own eyes!
She photographed it from about a million different angles!
There's a nice restaurant just down the street.
She's going to have the yukimisoba.
She likes the name!
Mm, that sounds good!
I'll have that, too!
Oh, here comes the waiter now!
What time is the next train?
No doubt one will arrive soon.
Oh, here it is!
Mr. X is over there!
He's getting off the train!
It's Kate Sawada, my favorite actress!
I saw her on TV.
Oh, I can't see her now...
I caught a small towel!
It hit me on the head!
Was he close by?
No, he was pretty far away.
He ate one bean.
Then he ate another bean.
Then he ate a third bean.
Let's make something together for Valentine's Day.
I have a magazine about Valentine's Day sweets.
Hey, this is good.
No, I got it at the library.
What should we make?
I looked at the magazine last night.
I put some sticky notes on some interesting recipes.
This truffle recipe looks delicious and easy.
OK, the truffles look and taste good.
We're ready for the final stage.
OK, girls, let's wrap them up!
Happy Valentine's Day, Shin!
This is for you.
Yeah, I made them with Miki and Judy for the whole class.
Oh, you gave them to everyone?
That's really nice of you.
It's really nice of all of you.
The school marathon is a good challenge.
I think so, too.
But it was a good long run for me.
Did you hear the discussion between Peter and Shin today?
Now they are rivals with each other.
Yeah, just a minute.
You should always have water with you during training, Judy.
I already drank it all!
Right at the end you overtook that other girl!
I really didn't expect this!
Tell us the secret of your triumph!
I didn't pay attention to the other runners.
I just ran and ran and ran.
Your concentration paid off.
Mr. X is sitting in our teashop!
Grandpa is carrying his mystery box over to Mr. X's table!
Oh, this is very mysterious!
Well, I am interested!
It is already March!
Yes, the school year is almost over.
Where did the time go?
There were festivals and parties and school events...
It was a great year.
A great year with great friends -I have no complaints!
Well, that is no surprise.
You love the story of Taro and Jiro!
Of course I do!
Don't you love it, too?
Of course, but I really loved the amusement park.
The rides were amazing!
The past year was good.
But I live in the present.
But it is almost lunchtime.
What do you say, everybody?
What do you mean?
Mr. X is over there!
He's talking with Miki and Maki's grandfather again!
Hey, Mr. Takumi is calling us over!
This is our chance!
Yes, Mr. Riddle is a cooking researcher.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Riddle.
You children look familiar.
Well, not exactly, but we know your face very well!
I don't show the contents of my box to many people but you children are special.
I won't forget it for the rest of my life.
Mr. Riddle, can you stay for dinner?
And children, can you all join us, too?
Oh, excuse me-I mean, Mr. Riddle!
I'm fine, thank you.
I'm fine, too, thank you.
Good morning, Ms. Supershot!
Nice to meet you.
The tea ceremony is so interesting.
Yes, it is very interesting.
Asakusa is a good place for you!
She is Junta's age.
This is the museum?
Yes, this is a model of the Nihonbashi Bridge.
This is so elegant!
They are all fantastic.
But yes, this is my favorite.
Junta, my question is for everyone.
Yes, the wagashi are almost untouched.
He is not a typical teashop customer.
Alice and Junta are half asleep.
We are almost ready.
Is he your grandfather?
Is that a special box?
It is a mystery.
This is our white heron dance!
That's a great picture!
That is the Binzasara dance.
Hey, isn't the man in the background familiar?
His face is familiar...
It is the man at the teashop in the museum!
That is a strange coincidence.
Is he a photographer?
Is he just a hungry tourist?
He is Mr. X.
A man of mystery!
Watson, you are not helpful!
You are very helpful.
What is that, Mrs. Takumi?
Rain, rain, go away!
That is Anna Smith's new single.
Hey, that's a good song for this season!
But it's very small.
Maki and I share a bedroom.
But my room is really, really small!
With one red berry on it?
Yes, he's a botanist!
Next week is the morning glory fair.
It's at Iriya Kishimojin Temple.
It's near Uguisudani station.
Well, maybe two or three times.
Hey, let's go to the morning glory fair!
That's a good idea!
I don't know Uguisudani station.
We take the Ginza Line to Ueno...
And then the Yamanote Line.
What would you like?
Do you want a yukata, Judy?
I know a good store.
No, the yukata are on sale now.
Thirty percent of 9,000 is 2,700.
We have another plant fair pretty soon!
It's a Chinese lantern plant fair.
Where do I go and what time?
My parents love wind-bells.
How many wind-bells do they have?
Oh, this is a good present for them!
That is 350 yen.
These wind-bells are beautiful.
Have a nice day!
What is this music?
Fireworks on the Sumida River are a tradition of many, many years.
More than 200, Peter.
For many Japanese people, fireworks are an important experience.
It's good old Mr. X!
By the bekko-ame stall.
Now I want some bekko-ame.
I want more information about Mr. X!
Miki and Maki's birthday is very soon.
Oh, I have no idea.
The party is on Sunday at 6:00.
And with the Swing Tower we can have a good view of Asakusa.
How about some lunch?
But you are still against natto, right?
Sorry, Maki, you must give up on that one!
One member of the team, Mr. Kitamura, returns.
But amazingly two dogs, Taro and Jiro, are alive!
A heartwarming reunion takes place between Mr. Kitamura and the dogs!
"Techniques in Observing Nature".
Look, the exhibition has information about telescopes, globes and so on.
My grandfather loves astronomy.
The Jomon period dates back to about 14,000 BC!
That's a good question.
It means "cord pattern".
Look at these pots.
Oh, yeah, I can see the cord pattern!
OK, let's go home then.
Oh, I can see Miki and Peter.
The average web user prints about 28 pages of paper daily!
What kind of information do people print?
My dad doesn't print anything.
He looks at information on screen, or writes it down in a notebook.
Those are great ideas!
Here is another message:
Oh, I get it.
My cousin Tomoko gets my hand-me-downs.
I can just imagine her happy face!
Mom, do you need this sheet?
It's for my Halloween costume.
You're not spooky, Junta.
That sheet has little pink flowers on it!
This family doesn't have any good sheets!
Well, we don't have any plain white sheets.
I want something exciting for my costume!
Where does Dad keep what?
What a big chef's hat!
Would you like some green tea, Miki?
Everything goes with pumpkin pie!
Well, black tea is my choice.
But thanks anyway, Maki.
Some people put milk in green tea.
Oh, I can't believe it!
Yes, I think so.
Oh, who has the key to the secret of Mr. X?
The theme of our exhibit is "Recycling Worldwide".
It has a bottle-cap locket!
I'm seeing these containers with new eyes!
Let's see the rest of the display!
Oh, I'm so proud of her!
Tsuru no Ongaeshi is a wonderful story.
The play is starting!
My video camera is ready!
Hmm... I know this taste... but what is it?
They are all typical Japanese ingredients.
No, I am not!
How about some curry?
Just a minute, am I forgetting something?
Oh, yes, the fukujin-zuke!
We can't throw them away!
Our theme is recycling!
Maybe we can use them for some other events.
What a nice surprise!
No, we're not living here, but we're visiting my husband's parents.
Miki and Maki are thirteen and Junta is eleven.
So you're just sightseeing in Asakusa?
Actually, I live here.
Just a minute for the tea.
You have a lovely house, Mary.
This is Kyosuke's parents' house.
We're living with them.
The family is all together.
Wait -is that my grandfather's box?
He's carrying a rake and a box.
I'm going to go with you!
Let's make a comment about the box.
It's for our Christmas concert.
I love "Joy to the World".
I love "Jingle Bells" the best!
So, what is our goal?
We must sing nice and loud!
But there's one key word.
It begins with "B".
How can we improve our sound, Mr. Melody?
An important part of singing in a chorus is listening.
OK, see you later, Mom and Dad!
What is the Hagoita-ichi?
Well, do you know hanetsuki?
Yes, it's a kind of Japanese badminton, right?
Yes, hagoita are the battledores for hanetsuki.
Many people buy them at the Hagoita-ichi.
This battledore looks just like Miki!
Not Maki, just Miki!
Oh, come on, Shin!
Oh, don't be silly.
Of course he doesn't.
He's always looking at you.
And now he's finding battledores with your face!
No, there aren't any rules.
The identity of each Secret Santa is a secret, of course.
Are there any gift guidelines?
Not really, but how about a limit of 1,000 yen for the presents?
Secret Santa is hard!
Why is it hard?
Oh, that's not really true.
You just need creativity and the proper Christmas spirit!
That's my New Year's resolution.
I don't have a New Year's resolution.
Well, of course there is.
But can I make a resolution and really stick to it?
Grandfather's box-that's my resolution.
What do you mean?
I will discover it!
Well, that's a tricky resolution but good luck!
Taro, Happy New Year!
Come out of your room.
I don't want to.
Taro, Happy New Year!
Maybe it's just a stage.
I don't need any otoshidama.
Because it's only 1,000 yen?
I want something priceless.
What does he want?
My son is a big fan of yours!
Hey, are you really a big fan of mine?
But I have a big problem right now.
Did you have strawberry ozoni this year, too?
I made a robot yesterday.
The robots want to see you, Taro.
Hello, this is Doc.
May I speak to Taro?
He isn't here now.
I just invented two types of strawberries.
This phone number is not in service...
Taro, why are you ignoring me?
Excuse me, I'm Doc.
I know this is Taro!
Taro, I invented some new strawberries.
Why do you hate me?
I found you, Taro.
Why are you avoiding me?
I can't see you anymore!
Who did you promise?
I can't tell you!
Grandpa, what is this?
This is my new invention.
you really don't know anything about Taro?
I already told you. I don't know!
Taro, your friend is here.
I'm not here now.
Isn't she your friend?
She is my ex-friend's granddaughter.
What are you doing?
I need a partner, but all of my friends are injured, so...
I have a broken heart.
If you join the fight with me, you can forget about the promise.
Thank you very much, Tomomi.
Taro, I can't hold on anymore.
Are you all right?
Actually, I'm going to the library.
Because I have to study snowball fighting, of course.
And you have to come with me, too.
Don't eat manju now.
That snow is dirty!
Let's review the competition again.
Taro, your snowballs were not round and hard enough.
That's all for our review!
Why did you only criticize me?
Now, Team Tomomi, please come here!
The final round is next.
Taro, remember the prize money.
I'm not nervous anymore.
And his father owns the batting center.
The snowball is going over 150 km an hour.
Oh, I have a good idea!
Tomomi is out because of you!
What are you talking about?
He looks really serious!
Hey, you! What are you going to do?
No, I won't help you!
You can quit now.
Well, let's take three steps, turn around and throw the snowballs, OK?
I will count to three!
I'm going to win!
No, I'm going to!
The prize money is for that!
I'll recharge my energy!
Isn't eating chocolate against the rules?
I'll recharge my energy, too!
Drinking that is against the rules, isn't it?
Excuse me, who won the fight?
Now we're deciding the winner from a photo.
Please wait a minute.
Men's snowball fights are so thrilling!
We checked the photo and the winner is Taro!
There's a ghost in the picture!
It's the snow woman!
Fighting like a man was your strategy?
That just came to me during the fight.
I hate such stupid ideas.
I'll teleport from here to America.
He is already in America, I imagine.
Well, it's already March.
But we may still need them at night.
The buttons of the time machine are greasy!
I have no idea.
It was you, wasn't it?
Don't go to the primitive times while eating potato chips.
What is this, Taro?
You spilled something on the kitchen floor.
Maybe the "Get Big" ingredients.
Cockroaches can eat them and get big!
Tomomi ran away from home?
Anyway, I have to look for her!
I'll just live by myself.
Don't come any closer!
When you fight, do it at home.
Look at the universe.
The fight between you guys is such a small thing.
He's right about that.
Make a happy family.
I can't start the spaceship engine.
What shall we do?
Nice to meet you, too.
Are you a samurai?
Taro, this is your robot.
This is your new robot.
My name is Taro, too.
I'm so sorry, everyone.
Where are you from?
What are your hobbies?
My hobbies are bonsai, shogi, igo, kyudo, and gateball.
Are you an old man?
And this is Saturn!
No, that is not Jupiter.
Sorry, I'm a stranger here.
Is this the "Go Home" button?
Is this the "Go Home" button?
Then, which is the "Go Home" button?
Let's watch a video.
Is that a UFO?
Is that an alien?
I am an alien.
Yes, I do, but I don't like aliens.
You look so strong!
You guys hate aliens, don't you?
Do you wanna fight?
We are your big fans.
Please give me your autograph.
Are you really my fans?
We have one request.
Um... what is it?
Can we use your toilet?
UFOs don't have a toilet.
Doc! Your spaceship is No.1 in the universe.
See...I am a great inventor.
Aliens... they're not so tough.
Actually, first place is ours.
I can't believe this!
It's an "invisible man" drink!
Right now, of course!
How long does it last?
I still see your clothes.
You mean "take off my clothes"?
Your body is invisible.
There are many inventors in the world.
I really like Thomas Edison.
I really like Doc.
But you only read manga.
Manga is a great part of Japanese culture.
I often use my time machine.
I often visit primitive times.
Because I love primitive times.
Yes. In that machine, only primitive times!
Tell me a lie, Taro.
What time is it now?
How old are you?
Oh, wait a minute.
Or... you really are 777.
What is the password for the safe, Doc?
OK... What is the real password?
I need some money.
I wanna buy more parts.
You mean it's not complete?
We must always work to improve.
Screws are cheap today.
You're just like my mother.
Now, answer "Yes" to my questions.
Do you eat bread with your nose?
Taro, please answer "Yes".
Oh, now I see!
I can't imagine you with bushy hair!
I want to see that!...
You can only go to the primitive times.
What are you talking about?
Who are all these people?
You have too much free time.
Do you know the story of Tanabata?
Orihime and Hikoboshi meet in the Milky Way just once a year.
I'm talking about romance!
They are not meeting now.
I want to meet them.
These are the leftovers from the "invisible man" drink.
Will you throw them away?
I'll help you instead.
You want some money, don't you?
I want a robot. It can do my summer homework.
Where are you going?
Doc, did you fail again?
No..., but maybe something is wrong.
He didn't do it last summer, either.
Doc, don't say that!
She's a mermaid, isn't she?
How do you know her?
I met her when I was surfing.
After all, she's half-fish.
For half-fish, I'm your man!
Thank you so much!
I'll play the harp for you.
After all, life on land is hard for her.
I'll miss her harp music.
First, pour the "Get Big" ingredients into a bowl.
As many as you like.
This is easy, isn't it?
And last, add some flavor.
You like strawberries, right?
Well, then, I'll put in a hundred!
Now I'm too big!
No, three bags of the "Get Big" ingredients was a bad idea.
You have one weak point.
What do you mean?
My data shows 80%.
You have another weak point.
Why didn't you tell me before the game?
Oh, I always look up.
From now on, I'll look down.
No, I want to win on my own.
You can teleport anywhere with this.
I want to teleport to Jupiter.
I want to use the teleport machine tomorrow.
Can I use it?
You don't want to teleport to school, do you?
I was late for school!
I'll try it again.
Let's have a race!
I beat you just by walking fast!
You lost! Now your punishment!
Taro! I'll remember this.
I'll try to win the "wanpaku" invention contest.
Because ballpoint pens are new to me.
You can't easily erase ink.
I just made a mistake!
Doc, winning this contest is difficult, isn't it?
You didn't hold your form tightly, did you?
Don't worry. I'll get it.
My form is on sale!
Welcome! This is my shop.
This form is cheap.
This acorn is also one yen.
I really want to win the contest.
Then, you need some training.
But only easy training, OK?
Is polishing the time machine really training?
Every beginner starts with polishing the machine.
Primitive time dirt is stubborn.
Take your time! Do it right!
Your "Japanese Hatsumei" set lunch!
You made it already?
Because I made instant noodles and curry rice.
I want some strawberries.
No way. A strawberry is not an invention.
Don't mix them up with mine.
Whose bouquet of flowers is this?
My birthday was a month ago.
Oh, I'm really sorry, dear.
Whose footsteps are these?
No, our next-door neighbor's.
Oh, just go to sleep...
It's your wedding anniversary today...
Whose picture is this?
Why do you have it?
It was on the floor.
Who are these people?
When is the invention contest?
I'll call the staff.
This is a prank by the contest favorites.
I don't think so.
They are all good guys.
They all look smart.
I'm no match for them.
I want to quit the contest.
Hairstyles don't make inventions.
Boys and girls, the first round will be a "decoration competition".
We don't invent anything?
You'll do that in the finals.
Please use them freely.
The second-round event is the "teleportation pose".
Then, make your best pose.
OK, the first competition is between Taro and Ryu.
Please help me again!
Why isn't he here now?
OK, Ryu, you go first!
That's a beautiful pose.
He gets 28 points.
I practice a lot.
I have a backache.
Then, how about a "U"?
You don't use your hands!
She is my granddaughter, Tomomi.
I found her by chance.
Are you in the contest, too?
If the light beam picks you up, you lose.
This time, an alien guest from Jupiter is helping us.
Hold the poles tightly!
Put the mirror above your head!
He is not my father.
OK. Mr. Alien, please pick them up!
The beam got me!
Look, Taro is blocking the light beam with his mirror.
The invention competition finally begins!
The final match is between Taro and Tomomi.
Doc, please say my name first!
Gee... I'm in trouble...
OK... go, Doc, go!
What's your plan, Tomomi?
Isn't that "sugoroku indoor shoes"?
Taro, you have a poor imagination.
What are you doing, Taro?
Gluing my dice is hard, too.
Well, we're even then.
Making inventions is hard work.
Please relax a little bit.
Taro, Tomomi, have a good nap!
Taro, if I win, please don't see my grandfather anymore.
Of course I'll win.
Then, do you promise?
Taro, say goodbye to my grandfather.
Taro, can I ask a question?
Oh, don't stop working.
What are you writing on the sunglasses?
"Ammonia water - Alkaline".
These are "Cheating Sunglasses".
Taro, don't invent bad things!
There's no time limit.
The dice seem fine.
Why do you want to change them?
Those sunglasses don't look good on you.
Taro, I'm done with mine.
Why are you putting brooms on the sunglasses?
I can't see the letters on these sunglasses. They are too close to me.
Maybe they look good on you.
Why did you change from the dice to the erasers?
Because the dice seemed painful.
Thank you very much!
Yeah! I wanna go!
Where are you going?
My homework is about my house.
I'm writing a diary.
My name is Waka.
I'm five years old.
I live in Edo Castle.
I only know a few of them....
Anyway, do you like my diary?
I never want to travel 3,000 kilometers again!
Somebody is talking about you, Hime-pyon.
Did you dream about Pyon and Don?
Oh, I'll write about this, too!
I liked their dance!
One, two, three, four, five, six steps....
What did you hear, Hime-pyon?
Do you remember "The Hundred-Step Dance"?
We danced it in April.
I just heard the song!
Happy New Year, Shogun!
Happy New Year, everyone!
Happy New Year, Waka-sama!
They are on their way.
I do not remember your name.
You are a very important lord.
Where do you live?
My name is Yanagisawa.
Where do you live?
I miss rice and miso soup!
I miss rice and miso soup, too.
With pickled vegetables, it's the perfect meal!
I like the Kansai-style zoni.
I'm from Kansai, you know.
Are you from Edo?
Tokyo was Edo a long time ago.
Well, little boy, you were not born a long time ago.
Hime-pyon and Aradon, "The Hundred-Step Dancers"?
THEY'RE "The Hundred-Step Dancers"?!
Long time no see!
You look great, guys!
You look great, too!
Bring in more zoni for them!
It's a special soup for New Year's.
It has rice cakes and vegetables in it!
Can I have three bowls of zoni, please?
Do you want more?
Thank you, but I had three helpings.
You had four, Aradon!
Yeah, we saw you!
Anyway, Shogun... we'll perform "The Hundred-Step Dance" in return for the zoni!
Your friends are here!
I want to dance with you!
You missed us, huh?
We missed you, too!
Did Peek-a-boo just say our names?
And... "Happy New Year"?
You can talk now!
Oh, Boo is your brother!
Here comes my son.
One, two, three, four, five, six steps....
Thank you for everything, Shogun!
Next time, I will visit you on Wonder Island.
I want to meet your parents, the King and Queen.
Please visit us soon!
What a huge sign!
Is it a map?
Only we can see it!
It's from the Voice!
We turn right here.
Is it pointing down?
You guys always forget about the secret letters!
So we have G, U, V, E, E, N, P, R, and V.
What words can you get from those letters?
I can spell the word "NEVER"!
But... does "NEVER UP" mean anything?
You almost have it!
Complete the message and help us!!!
Next month, Sho and Imo will go to different places!
Another sign from the Voice, under the V!
In the last eight months, you learned a lot of English.
So, you guys will go to different countries on your own!
Take me with you!!!
Good luck with your English training, Sho!
Me too, but we did it for them.
Where did they go?
Look at the warp tunnels.
Where did you come from?
I... came... from... from Japan.
It's on the right corner.
Are you here for lunch?
Are you here for lunch?
I learned that question.
You don't speak Japanese?
This is a Japanese restaurant, but I'm from China.
"Meat sauce spaghetti" is Japanese English, you know.
I didn't know that....
It's cha-han in Japanese and nasi goreng in Malay.
How many languages do you speak?
I speak Chinese, English, Malay, and a little Japanese.
Are you all by yourself?
You can stay with us!
I'm carsick again, and I'm freezing!!!
What are you wearing?!
Th... th... thank you.
You're about 80 miles north of Fairbanks.
This is a dogsled.
You can't ride a bike on the snow.
Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you, too.
Come to my house and get warm.
I like this place already!!!
How was ice fishing?
I caught these four char for dinner, and this boy!
He... fell from the sky somehow!
Did you really fall from the sky??!
It's a long story.
Well... I want to hear that long story over dinner!
So... you're travelling and learning English around the world...
With warp tunnels... looking for secret letters...?
I'm looking for my parents, too.
They disappeared 11 months ago.
I don't know yet.
What's your dad's job?
He studies grizzly bears.
They can run 50 kilometers per hour.
Look at the monitor, Hime-pyon.
Imo is washing dishes with Mei Li!
It's cute, and she's a good English teacher!
... taking a nap!
Wake up and find the letter!
Were you taking a nap?
Oh, I love rainbow trout.
I can eat ten of them!
Can't you think of anything other than food?!
How do I look in this tank top?
I want to wear a China dress.
It's "mandarin gown" in English.
How about this one?
Don't forget about the secret letter!
A fish is... umm... pulling...
You got a bite!
Don't pull too hard!
You almost have it!
You tried your best.
I love this place!
I came here last week, too!
I want a T-shirt with a wild design!
Where can I find one?
Aren't you coming with me?
No, I want to look at the skirts.
There are so many T-shirts!
How do you like this one?
You really have a good eye, honey!
That's the next letter!
Now, you can go back to Hime-pyon.
I miss Hime-pyon and Aradon, but I like Mei Li a lot.
Everything has an end.
This T-shirt is too big for you, Imo.
You don't like this shirt anymore?
The letter is in her name, Sho!
What did you say?
I want to stay here with Melody.
We have to get him!!!
Which letter is it?
Where are you, Imo?
Can I help you?
I can't find her anywhere!
Maybe she went to the restroom.
It's at the end of the aisle, on the left.
The letter is in her name, Sho!
What are you doing, Sho?
The monitor is broken!!!
We can't see Sho and Imo!
What are we going to do?!
Use your telepathy, Hime-pyon.
My telepathy... isn't working!!!
Your telepathy isn't working?!
Do you hear anything?
Put your hand on my head!
It's so dark here!
I can't hear her anymore!!!
Do you need help?
Where did you find it?
I sat on a bench and found it.
Would you give it back to her?
When did you last see him?
She said, "Aisle six, on the third shelf."
We came home, I went to call him for dinner, and he was gone!
First, he fell from the sky... then, he disappeared?
Is he invisible now?
So you found it on a bench?
You just said so!
Didn't you see her?
I heard her voice!
Just before I sat on the bench.
You won't believe me, but....
I heard her voice... from the sky!
Find the bookshelf labels, Sho!
You are at a library.
Find the final letter there.
It's in Melody's name.
Is it M... or E... or...?
Sit at the table in front of you.
Find the book Complete the Message and See your Parents.
Open it to page 83, and read it.
You're reading the wrong page!
It's a recipe for curry and rice!
Oh, I have to go to the hospital.
This story is about Melody!!
The fish was so creepy.
What's the common letter between her name and "eek"?
What's the common letter?
Now put the letters in the right order!
OK, Mom and Dad!
Why are you here?!
The monitor is working again!
Don't press the button too hard, OK?
That will break it again!
I got it, Hime-pyon.
They're back in Tokyo.
They're at the library near their house.
What are they doing?
How about this, Sho?
I can't find it in this dictionary.
How about "give up"?!
So the message is...
Let's go to the library and help them!
Let them finish their work!
Sho, Imo, why are you crying?
Maybe the curry is too spicy for them.
This English cookbook says...
Great job, Sho and Imo!!!
We're so proud of you!!
Thank you for everything!
Come to Japan, and I'll tell you the last secret letter!
Imo, how do you spell "Sincerely?"
Never give up, Sho!
Let's never give up, Imo!
I'm from Wonder Island.
What do you like?
Are you ready, Hime-pyon?
Peek-a-boo is so cute!
He's cute, but I'm busy!
I'm from Wonder Island.
My name is Hime-pyon.
My name is Hime-pyon?
My name is Sho.
Mom and Dad are speaking... English!
It's my English magic!
What did it say?
To see your parents, find 11 letters.
I can't wait that long!
Teach us the message now, Voice!
We don't have cherry blossoms on Wonder Island.
The first letter is ahead...
Look at the beautiful ladies in kimonos!
Look at the cherry trees, not the ladies!
Is it Monday, Tuesday, or...?
We came on the right day!
Oh, we have English class!
What do you mean?
You mean, four thirty?
Look at those people!
See the man in the center?
He is the Shogun.
Who are you strange people?
Look at their clothes!
You are the dancers for tonight's party, right?
We are a bit busy tonight.
Sounds OK to me!
By the way, what is your name, girl?
What is your name, boy?
My name is Sho.
What is the name of your dance?
It's "The Hundred-Step Dance"!
That's a strange title... OK, show it to me.
Seven, eight, nine, and ten steps...
One after ten is eleven...
Nineteen plus one is... twenty...
Twenty, twenty-one, and twenty-two plus seventy-three is...
You skipped too many numbers!
Did you find a letter?
Under the cherry tree.
It's not "ahead," it's on "a head."
On the top of Mr. Shogun's head!
I see the letter...
The first letter is "G"!
Is this the first letter in the message?
Now I can meet Queen Victoria!
And we can find our parents!
Into the deep blue sea!
Into the deep blue sea?
Find the next letter!
Are you a baby?
How old are you?
Then you're not a baby!
Into the deep blue sea!!!
Answer my question first.
I'm Mermaid Princess Hime-pyon!
Answer my question, Imo!
My dad is not a firefighter!
You are a mermaid, too?!
Now, I'm a merman whale!
Tell us about your parents.
Here in the sea?
My mom isn't very tall.
Your dad is very tall.
He is... 175 centimeters tall.
How tall is your mom?
She is... 155 centimeters tall.
Now, you are a mermaid and a merman!
Now, answer MY question!
Ten... Umm... September... I mean...
My birthday is October 15th!
My name is in October.
Your name is in October?
You are an October....
Now, hold my legs, everybody!
I'll take you to a wonderful place!
That palace is gorgeous!!!
Isn't that the famous Dragon Palace?
Yes, that is the Dragon Palace.
So the famous Princess Otohime lives there?
I want to meet her!
My name, address, and job?
My name is Hime-pyon.
My address is... Wonder Island.
My job is a princess.
You're next, Imo and Sho.
I'll help you, Imo.
Imo is an elementary school student, and I'm a junior high school student.
You're the famous Princess Otohime!!!
Nice to meet you.
I am Princess Otohime of the Dragon Palace.
What do you like?
Nice to meet you, too, Princess Otohime.
Who is that man?
Nice to meet you!
Please give me your autograph!
Nice to meet you, too.
I read your book a hundred times!
A toast to Hime-pyon and her friends!
We forgot about the second letter!
The Voice said, "One letter each month."
I'll miss you, Princess!
I'll give everybody these pretty shells.
Mr. Urashima, this box is your present.
The second letter is inside Mr. Urashima's box?!
I want to help you.
Oh... you're very old now.
Sorry, Mr. Urashima... but now you're famous!
Oh, we still have tails!
We still have tails.
Leave it to me!
My tail is gone!
I can't remember it!
Don't forget to write!
Oh, Sho and Imo are sleeping on the beach.
I want to meet Queen Victoria, NOW!
Look at the hands.
He's sitting on the Voice!
I want to meet Queen Victoria!
Let's go to Buckingham Palace.
I found it on my phone.
It looks like a forest.
I can't do this anymore!
What's wrong, little girl?
I miss my parents!
I want to go home!
My name is Ecila.
There you are, Imo!
I know you're homesick.
Right now, we're all lost!
The fairy says, "There are two hotels that way."
Only you can see me, Imo.
A small, cheap one and a big, expensive one!
I like the cheap one.
I'm waiting for payday.
I'll pay for all of us!
What kind of rooms do you want?
Aradon, Sho, you can choose your room first!
I'm big, and I like a big, big bed!
Here is your key.
I want the biggest room!
The last room left is our smallest room.
Who is paying for the rooms?
Where is your ATM?
What is an ATM, miss?
How will we pay?
What year is it?
Sir, this is Victorian London.
This hotel bill is a hundred years' salary!!
It's the size of a house!
Oh, she can't hear or see me...
Mom... Dad... Mom... Dad...
Oh... you're sleeping... and crying?
I can cheer her up!
You have a message.
A message for me?
That's a beautiful envelope!
Do you have a friend in London?
Vicky at Buckingham Palace....
I told Vicky about Hime-pyon, Imo!
Write her a reply.
I have to take a bath!
Hime-pyon... you look... beautiful in that dress...
You have another message.
The palace is so big!
Here's a message for you, Hime-pyon.
I see a hundred doors in this hallway!!!
Ni... ni... nice to...
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Nice to meet you.
I know, and you like apples, right?
Please give it to them.
It says, "Will Hime-pyon be Queen-pyon someday?"
My favorite book is about Ecila!
Nice to meet you!
I'm the real Alice, from Wonderland!
I just took a picture with Alice!
My phone is still working!
Let's all go out on the balcony and play!
We forgot about the letter again!
The hint was... "Look at the hands."
My hands don't look like a letter to me.
What's this huge shadow on the ground?
Hmm... I understand now.
One hundred dinosaurs live in the valley.
Your magic is tired out!
Peek-a-boo has a stomachache!
I'll call the Shaman!
He's speaking English now!
Well... I don't see any supermarkets.
How about dinner at my cave?
Nice to meet you, everyone!
I'm Jammy's mother, Ma-ja.
This is his father, Da-ja.
I'm fine, thank you.
This mammoth meat is a bit tough, but very good!
Hunger is the best sauce, Aradon!
Can I have some salt for my soup?
They don't use salt in this era yet.
Do you have any food for my brother?
Is it oatmeal or something?
I crushed some acorns for him.
They're good baby food.
Can you eat acorns?!
OK, I'll bring some goat milk for him.
That dinosaur's long neck is a good slide for Peek-a-boo.
See you later, Hime-pyon.
I'm going hunting with Aradon.
There's a dangerous cliff there.
Oh, what's the letter for this month?
Oh, that snake soup was good!
I want to eat it tonight, too!
No more snakes for me!
Do you want to go, too, Peek-a-boo?
Peek-a-boo is sitting on the dinosaur's head again!
Dinosaur, you're so brave!
You can't have a dinosaur boyfriend...
He looked at me again!!!
I just got a message from the king!
Come back for summer vacation.
We have to follow the king's orders!
Do you guys want to go to my house?
You mean, your castle?
I get dizzy in the warp tunnels...
Just this once, I'll take you to Wonder Island.
I want to stay here with my brave dinosaur.
I'll miss you, my darling!
We never found this month's letter!
I'll take a picture.
There are so many dinosaurs!
Show me the picture, Sho.
Where is my dinosaur?
Look at the picture!!!
Oh, the dinosaurs look like the letter...
The alarm clock is too loud!
Turn it off, Imo.
Good morning, Your Majesty.
How are you this morning?
How's the weather, Hime-pyon?
Bring me five glasses of milk.
Oh... and four pieces of toast....
Two cups of tea... and...
He's big, so he eats a lot!
I had a strange dream last night.
I saw sand around them.
Are you still dreaming, Imo?
Maybe it's a hint for the next secret letter.
Your hint is, the three triangles and sand...
You can't come with us, Peek-a-boo.
Oh, what a pretty cloud!
The Voice from the sky!
Wait a minute, Voice!
Your next fantasy adventure starts NOW!
Three triangles and sand??
Have a nice trip, everyone.
I don't see any sand or triangles.
It looks like a garden.
A huge, beautiful garden!
I see a palace!
I also see a... um...
That's a temple, Imo.
War, my dear Cleopatra!
We can meet Cleopatra!
Then... that man... is Julius Caesar!!!
You are beautiful and smart.
You are handsome and brave!
The real Cleopatra and Caesar!
Well... Cleopatra is young, but Caesar is old.
Tell us about Cleopatra, Aradon.
The famous Cleopatra is "Cleopatra VII."
She is the Queen of Egypt.
Oh, we're in Egypt now?
It's a country in north Africa.
I don't see any lions.
I see a camel over there!
Caesar and Cleopatra fell in love at first sight!
What year is it?
It's about 48 B.C.
A long time ago!
What's that long thing over there?
That's a... that's a... cobra!!!
You're the famous Hime-pyon?
Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you, too!
His hand is so big and strong!
How old are you, Cleopatra?
I'm 21 years old.
She is very smart.
She can speak many languages.
I can only speak Japanese.
Thank you, Mr. Caesar.
Thank you, but this is my boat.
How long is it?
It's about a hundred meters long.
Oh, I love fried chicken!
By the way, what's your next secret letter?
The hint was, "three triangles and sand."
Can I borrow a flashlight?
Sure, you can use a torch.
Aren't the pyramids closed?
This camel ride is fun!
You have a weak stomach, Sho!
What's that sign over there?
The pyramid is ALL rocks!!!
Let's climb these stairs.
Oh... just a hundred or so.
This tunnel is endless!
By the way, how tall is this pyramid?
Here we are, everyone!
This is King Khufu's room.
Hey, we're deep inside the pyramid, but I hear a lot of noise!
Yes, it's a roaring sound.
Maybe it's a ghost!
I see another sign.
It's a stone coffin.
The lid is very heavy.
I hear a noise from inside!
The voice sounds very familiar.
Let's open the coffin!
The lid is so heavy...
What are you doing in there?!
Peek-a-boo is holding Khufu's scepter!
You can't play with a king's scepter!
He has a sign from the Voice.
Something is on the back!
It's a map of the world.
Where are we now?
To the east of Egypt is...
The map says, "The United States of America."
It's a map of our time!
You went too far East.
I want to ride an elephant!
We can meet Genghis Khan!
Give them a hint.
Does Peek-a-boo speak Chinese?
The Voice only taught him that phrase.
Here's a simple quiz for you.
On the count of three...
He was very old.
He was five hundred years old.
It's a picture book of an old story.
He had very long gray hair.
How long was it?
It was nine thousand meters long.
You couldn't cut your hair or beard in the old times.
Because your parents gave them to you.
Did you give my hair to me, Dad?
Do you have sorrow in your beard, too?
Well... I don't know.
I don't like this book.
This is your English homework.
I know this story.
I don't like a long beard.
What do you mean?
I'm an astronaut, and you like space, too.
Yeah, and you'll leave on your next mission tomorrow!
That man is an astronaut?!
I want to go to the space station, too!
Oh, you speak English very well!
Sorry to surprise you.
We're traveling around the world.
Nice to meet you.
Look at this page.
It's the inside of the space station.
This is a big international project.
This lasagna was very good.
Do you have salad, too?
We have chicken salad.
I want to go with you!
Sorry, but you can't come.
I work and eat there.
Oh, it's like a dollhouse.
We're on the space station?
I have to call Captain Strongarm!
Your father is so cool.
He's an astronaut and speaks perfect English!
Hi, this is Wang.
Please call me back.
It was an answering machine.
I left a message.
Well... it usually starts with "Thank you for calling." or "This is Wang Qiang."
It said, "We'll return your call as soon as possible."
Call the Voice for a hint.
A hint for the next secret letter!
Call the Voice right now!
What is the Voice's phone number?
Hi, thank you for calling.
Look at page 158 in the manual.
The answer is the food on the plate.
Let's eat the noodles.
There are two kinds.
Which do you like?
Finish your noodles quickly!
Let's find our next goal!
Well, my watch says November 5th.
Our next goal is the past!
Our next goal is...
Eat the ramen, too!
She likes udon, but she doesn't like ramen.
Then give it to me!
Think about our next letter, Aradon!
What letters do we have so far?
"E" in July, and "E" again in September, and...
So we have "G", "U", "V", "E", "E", and "N".
The message is GUVEEN!!!
Aradon... what does it mean?
Oh, I love that song.
Our next goal is... old-time America!
Oh, my shoulder hurts!
It looks like a shop.
Are you a new kid in town?
What do you need?
Do you want whiskey?
Give me a bottle of Three Roses.
Give me this beef jerky, too.
That... that customer has a...
You're a lively bunch!
Don't shoot me, sir!
I don't have any money!
Where are you from?
Not really... we fly.
What is the date?
You want those ropes?
Have a good day!
This is Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
Welcome back to Joe's A-GO, guys!
So... where is the ceremony?
It's at the cemetery.
How far is it from here?
I don't like walking.
It's about 1.6 kilometers.
Then turn right at the third corner... wait a minute.
Look at this map and the photo.
What an old photo!
It's black and white!
You're on Eugene Street now.
Then walk straight for a while.
Turn left at the theater in the photo, then walk straight again.
Turn right, and turn left, and....
What time is the speech?
It starts at three or so.
It's only one p.m.
There's a restaurant next door.
It's called Getty's Burgers.
I want four pieces of roast beef, three cups of coffee, five hamburgers, and...
Are you here for lunch?
Yes, we're very hungry.
I want four pieces of roast beef, three cups of coffee, five hamburgers, and...
Let me write down your order.
We can't forget about our mission.
I want to see my parents.
Would you like some coffee, sweetheart?
Can I have some orange juice, please?
What's the next letter?
I can't think on an empty stomach.
You said "in a second" twenty minutes ago!
These hamburgers are good!
What time is it now, Sho?
That man over there is so...
... and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, ...
But... what's the letter?
Abraham Lincoln just said the letter six times.
... shall not perish from the earth.
My speech wasn't very good.
It was a great speech!
I didn't understand it...
You just heard the greatest speech of all time!
We're not bad guys!
Bad guys always say that!
Well... my name is Aradon.
And my phone number is 001.
It's Wonder Island 001.
Do you play the saxophone?
Hime-pyon, they don't have phones yet!
I want to hear more.
Come to my house sometime!
I think we're near the White House.
President Lincoln is walking this way!
It's nice to see you again!
Are you taking a walk?
Go to my house.
Imo can have some hot soup there.
How can we get to the White House?
Thank you, Mr. President!
The White House is so big!
Umm... where's the kitchen?
I want another helping.
Why are you still in America?
Go to the next place!
I want to go to a warm place!
My back... doesn't hurt!?
We're on a beach!
It's summer... in December?
Isn't that cape hot?
Did you hear that?
"Good day, mate" is a famous Australian phrase!
That's a good question.
Australia is a huge country.
Where did you come from?
Can you tell me the way to a car rental agency?
I want to drive around Australia!
May I help you?
Yes, we need a car.
We want to drive around the country.
In that case, how about a camper?
It eats a lot of petro, but it has a kitchen, beds, and a bathroom.
It's 300 dollars, plus petro.
Let's see... about 25,000 yen a day?!
How long do you need it?
That's 2,300 dollars including everything.
Have a nice trip!
By the way, where are we?
You're at Bondi Beach.
It's a very famous surfing spot!
Where can we buy some food?
I'm tired, and worried about paying for the camper.
Besides, I can use my ATM card here.
In that case, let's have a big Christmas party!
Look at my pajamas!
Look at that cool surfer with the white beard!
3,000 kilometers west... 348 meters up....
Look at the sky...
The hints for the next letter!
Bring a map, Sho!
We're going west to... Uluru!
Hang in there, Aradon!
You're a great driver!
The cool surfer with the white beard!
Go back to that corner, and turn right.
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...
I'm going to make it!
Hey, look at that shining mountain!
That's not a mountain.
It's a giant rock.
The sun is setting, and the rock is changing colors!
Is there a parking lot near here?
The Voice's last hint was, "Look at the sky..."
The surfer with the white beard...
His sleigh looks like...
We miss our parents...
I miss the camper!
This is Peach Boy.
He was born from a peach, so his name is Peach Boy!
Don't poke my nose, Honey!
The answer is... my nose!
They had no children.
One day, the wife saw a huge peach floating down the river.
Whose peach was it?
Don't ask so many questions.
Because this is an old story!
Just enjoy it, OK?!!!
Where was their house?
The peach was about... this big!
Happy New Year, Mr. Asaki!
Where are you going, Keiji?
I have some important detective work!
You're three years old, right?
Uh, it's very nice to meet you!
You can't fool me, Honey!
It's your index finger!
It's... Mr. Asaki's hair!!!
Why are you hiding?
We can see you, Keiji!
He ran away... again!
Momotaro is "Peach Boy" in English?
Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was an old couple.
Let's go for a walk!
You have a cute bag, Honey!
Wait, where is Honey?
I don't want to!
I'll send a photo of her!
She had a bag, right?
I'll give you clues to find her!
Did you look in her bag, Nuru?
It's rude to look in someone's bag...
She'll drop things from her bag!
Those are your clues!
I have a notepad and a mechanical pencil!
I'll send another photo!
Did you get it?
We're looking for a bracelet with red beads.
I saw that bracelet in the park.
Another photo from Mr. Asaki!
We're looking for a toothpaste.
You can buy toothpaste at the convenience store.
Oh, I love that song!
This is no time to sing!
This is the last photo!
These are... American coins.
3 dimes, 2 pennies, a quarter, and a nickel!
Whose underwear is this?
Thank you, Mr. Asaki!
I can hear water...
Are you at a bathhouse?!
I'll send my assistant!
Why are you here?!
Mr. Asaki sent you??!
You and Mr. Asaki are enemies!
Look at that old tree!
We found a yellow ribbon, but nothing else...
What about that huge teddy bear in front of the hamburger shop?
It has pennies on its eyes!
They're Honey's American coins!
She drew an arrow with her toothpaste!
We're back at Mr. Asaki's office.
We didn't find her.
Look at the doorknob!
She led us back here on purpose?
She's a troublemaker, but so cute!
Yume and Nuru are gone!
No calls, no text messages for three days!
I need some music.
They don't even talk to me at school.
I don't need them!
They always need me!
Are they planning something without me?!
She solved so many mysteries, and the school year is almost over!
We still have February and March!
Last month, she found most of the important clues!
She was so cool!
Why don't they text me?
We always solved mysteries together!
It was always me.
I don't need to ask that question!
No need to lie!
Don't you want to solve a mystery yourself?
Don't you want to look smart for once?!
Oh, I got it!
You're jealous of Iroha!
I just want to solve mysteries!
Hmm... I have an idea!
Why is it "V"?
What does the "V" stand for?
What month is it now?
So I'm naming it "Mystery V" because...
You're worrying about Yume and Nuru all day!
Do you have a spy mic in my room?!
I'm calling the police right now!
I won't call the police.
You're a strange guy, but you're still my cousin.
Thanks for the compliment, Iroha!
What do you want?
You finally asked me the important question!
You want to help me?!
Where are Yume and Nuru?
They're at Yume's house!
Nuru secretly hired two detectives!
You're Atami Nuruo, right?
And... you're Haruno Yume, right?
Nice to meet you!
How do you know my name?!
Look at this photo!
What day of the month was last Thursday?
One day before the 14th!
What day was the 14th?!
Well, Valentine's Day was the 14th.
Naram bought a lot of cocoa beans!
What did she do with them?
You really have a good friend, Nuruo.
You only paid us 10,000 yen, and your time is up!
Did she give the chocolate to somebody?!
She's a good detective, but she's not good at making sweets!
Turn right at the next corner, and it's the second apartment building on the left.
Turn right, and... I'm here!
What an old building!
Oh, I can't do this!
You want to give him the chocolate, but you can't, right?
We'll give it to him for you!
I put an address in your pocket!
A late valentine from... Naram?!
Why are you here?!
You shadowed Naram, and I shadowed you!
You did a great job, Yume and Nuru!
I'm so proud of you!
A text message from Nuru!
Naram gave chocolate to...!
Another message, from Yume!
We left you out this time!
So you wanted to solve a mystery on your own!
The Asaki residence is nearby...
Hmm.... The Asaki residence is nearby...
Walk three blocks, and it's on your right.
Walk three blocks, and...
What a strange old man!
Come in, Ms. Heston!
H... how do you know my name?!
You know my name, too?
Ms. Heston is lucky, you know.
Your name is in Iroha's song, too.
Did you write a song, Iroha?
Sing it for us!
Ha... ha... Mr. Asaki is a genius!
Who were those people in black suits?
You're my hero, Detective X!
What song is that?
I brought you some water, Iroha!
I'm cleaning them now.
Not in my cup!
Iroha's song is the key to this mystery!
But I never wrote a song!
It's like an old Japanese ABC song.
Our ancestors used I, Ro, Ha, Ni, ....
I, Ro, Ha,... Ni, Ho,...
The little girl in November!
I'm Keiji's grandfather, too!
What about MY name?
I, Ro, Ha... Nu, Ru!!!
Your name is in it, too, Nuru!
Then why did you ask Iroha's grandpa?
Is anyone else hungry?
My name is in it, and my cat's, too!
A, Sa, Ki, Yu, Me, Mi, Shi....
Mi, Shi sounds like "Missy" in English.
Niho's cat Mose is in Iroha Uta, too!
And... Keiji's mother, Wakayo!
You're still a great detective, Grandpa!
H... how old are you?!
I was 80 years old five years ago.
You mean... Ta, Re, So...?
I'll miss you, my grandson!
What are you talking about?
This is the biggest mystery of the whole year!
What other names fit into Iroha Uta, kids?
I, Ro, Ha and Ni, Ho....
Iroha's grandpa Tsuneo, and you, Detective X!
Mr. Ui and Ms. Okuyama, right?
Kyota is Yume's dad, Asaki, Ms. Okuyama's best friend, Saki...
That's Agent Heston and Agent Case.
"He, Su, To, N and Ke, I, Su."
... so their code names are scrambled!
"Tareso" is "WHO" in old Japanese!
You're so amazing, Detective X!
Well... we still have... No, Wo...
What did you get?
What time is it?
We can sleep on the mystery!
Grandpa usually goes to bed at seven.
Does he have jet lag or something?!
Focus on the mystery, guys!
"No, Wo, Ko, E, Te."
"Going over the field!"
"Who is going over the field?"
What does that mean?
A note from Mr. Asaki!
I'm going to Paris to join Interpol!
Naram is now in charge of my detective office!
I'm proud of you!
I miss him already!
We can do it!
He wasn't so bad...
Here I am, "No wo koete!"
You came from the small field Tokyo...
...over to the international field of Interpol!
I want to take a nap!
You see that man over there?
That's the president of...!!
I'm Asaki, a genius.
I'm a private detective.
This month, find a word!
Detective Asaki is my cousin.
My cousin is strange.
I help Detective Asaki.
I was born on April 4.
I'm thirteen years old.
I like him all right!
And this car is....
Write the word on this card.
A baby is small!
How do you spell the word?
It's not a baby!
Look at this card.
A ball is... a ball.
Then a ruler is...
What day is it today, Nuruo?
One, two, three, four, five...
... ten, eleven, twelve....
You are a genius, too!
What's the last letter?
What does that mean?
What's your phone number?
What's the last number?
The word for this month has six letters.
What is the word?!
Give me a break!
Do you have a ROUND book?
Huh... what is the word?!
Good morning, Ms. Okuyama!
That's page eight, Nuru.
Stand up and read page eighteen.
The seven days of the week.
Sunday... Monday... Tue... Tue...
That's all for today.
Aoi, Atami, and Haruno!
A message for you from "Mr. ... Genius"?
Thank you, Mr. Ui!
We have... small... round... flat... sweet... brown...
Two O's, and six letters.
I got it, it's a ●●●●●●.
And that's a clue for May!
Long time no see, Asaki!
Mr. Asaki's car is huge!
It's just a toy.
My favorite TV show starts at four!
Is it on Channel B?
You mean, "Love After the Rain"?
That show is on Wednesday!
Call me... Detective X!
You have a message from Ms. Okuyama.
Somebody eats my cookies every night.
Can you come to my house on the 30th, at four thirty?"
You have the wrong number!
This is Asaki speaking.
Wow, what a fantastic mansion!
Mr. Asaki is so nervous!
Yes, I feel great!
Do you still have my message?
"Somebody eats my cookies every night.
Can I see the cookies?
Hmm... maybe it's your mother.
My mother doesn't like cookies, Mr. Asaki.
Just in case, let's put this spy mic under the table.
Who ate Ms. Okuyama's cookies?
They're small, round, flat, sweet, brown, and...
Look at them, carefully.
They have tiny teeth marks.
Come to my house tonight, OK?
Is Iroha here, too?
Detective X is here, too!
How did you know...?
Good evening, Mr. Asaki!
Why are you here?
Let's check the recording for proof.
You don't have a clue, Asaki.
Let's listen to the recording.
I don't hear anything.
Did you hear it?
I hear it, too!
Now I hear a crunching sound!
It's eating the cookies.
You can use the room next to the living room.
Ms. Okuyama has a cat, and somebody eats her cookies?
So the cat is the culprit?
Where is the cat?
I have the net, Mr. Asaki!
Go and catch it!
Aren't you coming with us?
Um... I have a headache.
The culprit is gone!
I forgot my bag.
Tonight, catch the culprit!
Last night, you sneezed, and the culprit ran away!
Go to the right.
Go to the left!
We'll chase it from three sides!
What about you, Mr. Asaki?
I got something in my net!
You got the cookies!
This is the culprit!
The clue was... the TINY teeth marks!
Ms. Okuyama doesn't have a cat, Asaki.
"Cookie" and "mouse"... what's next?
Thank you for inviting us, Mrs. Haruno.
It's our pleasure, Mr. Asaki.
How about some more carrot glacé?
I'm not a horse!
Horses are very smart!
Yume is always talking about you.
You're a genius, right?
My father is designing a new video game.
And how are you, Mr. Asaki?
Thank you, Mrs. Haruno.
Everybody is strange in their own way!
How about some more roast beef?
S... s... so what?
We don't have cookies.
We have crème brûlée instead.
You're not a picky eater!
My mother is a wonderful cook!
The dessert was delicious, Mrs. Haruno!
Naturally, the meat loaf was wonderful, too!
Don't forget the carrot glacé!
Detective Asaki is a crime-fighting genius, and Yume's mother is a gourmet genius!
I didn't know that!
You never listen to anyone!
I'm a little absent-minded tonight.
It's past my curfew!
A genius detective... with a curfew...
Oh, you can't eat it?
You have a curfew, Mr. Asaki?
How old are you, Keiji?
I'm 35 years old!
You look very young for your age!
That's not the point, Mrs. Haruno.
I only have a curfew on Wednesday night!
I read stories in French.
Can I go to your house, Mr. Asaki?
I want to hear your French!
Let's go another time, Nuruo.
Can I have your phone number?
Come on in, Mr. Haruno!
How did you know...?
This is my only appointment this month!
Well... you're a genius, right?
Most people don't understand that.
How did you know that?!
Simple detective work, Mr. Haruno!
Nobody can fool me, Mr. Haruno!
I can fool you, Asaki!
His fake moustache and glasses were very cheap.
Disguises and worn-out shoes are the mark of a detective.
His nose was fake, too, Asaki!
You can't beat me this month, Naram!!
Your team has five members.
One of them copied your new program...
...and put a bug in the original!
But which person did it?
Can you help me, Mr. Asaki?
I'm Detective X, Mr. Haruno!
Maybe I can hire her.
She's just a high school student.
Look at this machine!
It looks like a music player.
It's a wireless polygraph.
I built it myself!
Who is the culprit?
A, B, C or D?
Hmm... these headphones send wireless signals to the main machine... through these blue and red antennas.
You lie, and this machine beeps!
Mr. B and Mr. C...
Did you steal the program?
How about you, Ms. D?
Asaki is wrong again!
Ms. D is... innocent!!!
It was Mr. B and C!
How did he know?!
Naram switched the antennas!
I'm the real genius!
You can't have my blood!!!
What's wrong with him?
Don't answer my phone!
Did I call the wrong number?
I need my blood!!!
Is that my cousin?
He isn't in his office lately.
He screams in his sleep.
Do you want a new mystery?
Call Yume and tell her.
Come to my place next Monday.
Long time no see, kids!
We saw you last Wednesday, Mr. Aoi!
My cousin is the mystery for this month!
He screams in his sleep every night.
So we'll solve the mystery of his nightmares!
You look tired, Mrs. Asaki.
He never goes to work lately.
What does he say in his sleep?
A lot of things.
They always start with "B."
"Buh" or " Beh."
Something in his dream scares him.
Hmm... I got it!
Are you scared of bananas?
What else does he say, Aunt Wakayo?
He says, "Go away! I need my blood!"
Do you have a stomachache again?
Take a bite, Mr. Asaki!
"Go away" and "My blood."
I said, "Take a bite, Mr. Asaki!"
And he ran away!
He gets up late.
He eats breakfast, and goes to work at three o'clock.
Why does he go at three o'clock?
He likes the number "3"!!
I'm not scared of mosquitoes.
How about you, Iroha?
What does he do first at work?
He takes another nap.
Doesn't he do any work at all?
Well... he usually has just one client a month.
You're on the right track, Iroha!
So... what's the next step, Iroha?
What can I do for you?
He usually never sleeps at home.
Always in his office.
Something is definitely biting Asaki lately.
She slept in Asaki's office.
They're tiny... brown, and...
You have enough clues, Iroha.
We know your secret, Asaki!
Small, brown and round....
Do cookies steal your blood?!
Last month's telephone bill....
This is Mother's bill.
It's going to be fun!
She's on the phone again?!
The bill... from Naram!
The bill from Naram.
She's nice sometimes, and she's a pretty good detective!
The envelope is open!
This is Detective X.
Please leave a message after the beep.
Why does this bill have hearts all over it?
We're going on vacation to Karuizawa!
You can bring your little friends.
Oh, and invite Naram, too.
I saw that bill!
Cleaning your room is my hobby!
Your plan is amazing, Aunt Wakayo!
I'll call Naram right now.
We're going to Aunt Wakayo's villa tomorrow!
There's a graveyard nearby, and we'll have a courage test!
My schedule is... flexible.
Let's scare my cousin together!
It's so early, Mr. Asaki!
My body clock is set to US time!
I don't understand him.
Check the route with your phone, Nuru!
Reading a map is good detective practice!
I have a terrible stomachache!
Are you all right, Mrs. Asaki?
She used too much pale makeup.
It's part of the plan.
Have a nice trip, everyone!
I hope you feel better soon, Mrs. Asaki!
I'm sure she's fine.
Our plan will scare your son to death!
Don't forget your mask!
Nuruo will buy one for me.
See you at the coffee shop near Karuizawa Station!
Do you see the blue wooden house?
This is our first time in Karuizawa...
...enjoy some fresh air!
My villa has a great hot spring!
...so we want to take a walk, and...
The shop is around here somewhere.
Look at that sign!
Why is it so dark in here?
May I help you?
Your order is ready!
Why do you need only one mask?
The girls don't need masks!
3,500 dollars including tax.
That's about 300,000 yen!!!!
Hey, where's my cousin?
He's singing in the hot spring!
Let's hide the box!
How about under the terrace?
You lost the receipt?!
Thank you for the wonderful dinner, Mr. Asaki!
Do you like graveyards, Yume?
Mrs. Asaki and Naram...
We'll go into the graveyard separately, OK?
How is my makeup?
I hate to say this Ma'am, but you look REALLY scary!
We did it, Mr. Asaki!
What are you doing?
Naram grabbed me so strongly....
That bill with the hearts....
How did you know about our plan, Mr. Asaki?
So what gave us away?
Mother had pale makeup on her clothes.
She also opened Naram's bill.
So, I turned on all the spy mics in my house and heard her talking to Naram!
You put spy mics all over the house?!
Because you always go into my room!
Now, we're even, Mother!
He was 100 steps ahead of me.
I can't even beat Keiji?
Answer your phone, Iroha!
You're there, aren't you?
A genius can sense it!
You're not answering my calls, huh?
But don't you want to know about... A MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE??
You're so noisy, Keiji!
This message is already mysterious!
Keiji really gets on my nerves... but what mystery message is he talking about?
This is Atami Nuruo.
Sorry I can't answer....
Don't cough in your voicemail!
Sorry, I'm practicing my voicemail message, but I'm very nervous.
How about a new mystery?
We have a new mystery!
Is this Keiji's mystery message?
She's not interested in the new mystery?
Wait, but she's asking, "What is it?"
Nobody can fool ME!
Bring her to my house tonight!
I brought souvenirs from America!
Good evening, Mrs. Asaki!
You went to America?
My friend lives in San Francisco.
It's a big state, isn't it?
It's a city, Nuru!
Who is this from?
How does she always know about our secret meetings?
I just posted, "Secret meeting at Mr. Asaki's house tonight at 7:30" to my blog.
Let's finish our meeting early!
She isn't here yet!
Would you excuse us, Mother?
We have a secret meeting.
Oh, before I go, would you like some tea?
Earl Grey tea for everyone, Mother!
I recorded a strange phone call the other day.
Who was it from?
How about some cake?
Left over from my wedding.
Your wedding was 36 years ago!
How old is this sponge cake?
I bought it this afternoon.
I was taking a nap, and someone left this mysterious message on my answering machine.
Sorry, I have allergies.
I called Mr. G!"
Does he like you, Mr. Asaki??
No, he clearly dialed Asaki by mistake.
Did you notice anything?
This cake is very good!
Yume, what's that next to the chocolate cake?
His voice is muffled by an allergy mask.
You all know this man!
This voice is familiar...
Listen to the recording one more time!
Sorry, I have allergies.
My number ends with 3014.
He was calling 3013.
Why did he misdial?
Because... he was on Platform 14!
I like the crepes in Shibuya!
I like the takoyaki in Ikebukuro.
You missed the clue!
Listen to the last part.
Who calls Mr. Asaki "Mr. G..."?
I called Mr. G!"
Mr. Ui calls Keiji "Mr. Genius"!!!
I'm proud of you!
But who was Mr. Ui trying to call?
How was your date, Mr. Ui?
Was the volunteer club busy?
Every fish has a name!
This bucket is heavy!
You'll be a professional sushi chef someday!
Why are you up on the fence?!
Mose jumped up here, so I followed her.
Sardines are Mose's favorite!
What time is it?
Oh, it's four thirty already!
It's time to go, Niho!
Aren't you Mr. Asaki?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Nuruo's classmate, Eita.
You're a genius, right?!
Well, people do call me that-choo!
Do you have a cold?
Good idea, young lady!
Take the cat with-choo!
I have to hurry!
You're not coming to the park with us, Eita?
Eita disappears after school every day!
What's the matter with him?
You know, he sits next to me in class, and I saw his test score.
He got a perfect score, right?
He's always the top student.
His score was 74%!
He always gets a hundred!
Our scores were close!
I'm proud of myself!
Our classmate is acting strange these days.
How did you know?
You ARE a genius!
What does he do?
You want the answers, don't you?
We catch his shadow!
How do we do that??
You mean... secretly follow him like a shadow?
That's my cousin, Iroha!
Are you praising your cousin or yourself?
OK, this month I'll teach you the ABC's of REAL detective work.
Rule 1: Be quiet!
Look at the map!
It's not circled, so it's either an elementary school or a junior high school.
It's our old elementary school!
Why is he going to Sezu Elementary?
Rule 2: Be quick!
Where are you, Mr. Asaki?
You have a long way to go!
That's Rule 3, right?
Rule 3: Use your brain!
Of course... but you can see him from here.
Oh, I have wonderful memories about this place.
Lunchtime... recess... spring vacation... summer vacation....
Didn't you ever study?!
Thanks for waiting, Eita!
She's running more than two steps!
Remember Rule 3 and use your brain!
Nuru, which do you like?
I like going for walks!
My first name isn't Roger!
Who is this Niho girl?
Eita is an only child.
Don't Detective X and Missy usually show up by now?
Luckily, she's too busy right now.
Her midterm exams are next week!
Where are they going?
You know the answers already?!
Eita's family owns a sushi restaurant, and Niho is a customer's daughter.
They're going into the community center.
He tutors Niho every evening.
You got a 74% on your test, because you spend all your time with Niho?!
It's too cold to go to school!
Never say die, Nuru!
I didn't say "die"!
It means, "Don't complain!"
Oh, I can't wait for Christmas!
Mr. Ui is getting off the bus!
He's coming this way!
Of course, he is.
He's going to school, too!
You're so funny, Mr. Ui!
Ms. Okuyama loves comedians.
So... she loves me?!
Nice detective work, Mr.Ui!
Did you hear me?!
Ms. Okuyama loves Mr. Ui?!
Does that mean yes?
I feel so sorry for him... hahaha...
You feel sorry for him???
That's not like you, Keiji!
You saw through me!
Are you talking about steak?
We're going to get Ms. Okuyama snd Mr. Ui together!
Another easy case, Asaki?
Don't you have exams?!
I'm jealous, Detective X!
I agree with Naram!
Don't worry, Mr. Asaki!
Where are Ms. Okuyama and Mr. Ui?
Mr. Ui is still barking.
Now he's chasing his tail.
He doesn't even have a tail...
Maybe we can help him?
The key to this problem... is jealousy!
You're playing with fire!
It's not a bad idea, Naram!
You're just jealous of my brilliance!
We're still missing pieces of the puzzle!
The next clue is... "the best friend"!
We'll make Mr. Ui and Ms. Okuyama best friends!
I agree with Naram, Keiji.
Don't play around with love!
It's too early, Nuru!
Oh, I miss my parents!
Are Kyota and Chiri out of town?
I won't see them until dinnertime.
We solve mysteries, but we'll never understand Yume...
How do we solve our mystery, Nuru?
Um... jealousy... Mr. Ui, Ms. Okuyama and... "the best friend"....
I'm going to write to Ms. Okuyama and Mr.Ui!
You're on the right track, Yume!
The key... is Ms. Okuyama's best friend.
We make Ms. Okuyama jealous of her best friend!
Look, I bought this card for Grandpa today.
You're no help at all!
Mr. G's Christmas party invitation just says "The big house."
Does Mr "Apasaki" live near here?
You mean Mr. Asaki?
Asaki told me about you!
Good things, I hope!
That's his house over there.
Let's go, Mr. Ui!
Ms. Okuyama is the best teacher at our school!
She's coming to the party, right?
I said, "She's coming, right?"
I didn't know that!!
Oh, isn't that Saki?
I can do a monkey, too!
Stop it, Mr. Ui!
Ms. Oku... are you crying?
Mr. Ui and Saki were talking... and laughing so happily...
Did you invite me here to make her jealous?
I came to show you my new engagement ring!
I tricked all of you!
I just wanted Mr. Ui and Ms. Okuyama to get together!
...Do yo like movies, Ms. Okuyama?
I don't hate them, Mr. Ui.
Love is too complicated, Evev for a genius...
I know everything about you.
You're thinking about Fukuta.
That's a beautiful white dress!
It's from Grandma Daisy!
Grandma is in Asakusa with Daffodil.
Grandma loves Japanese culture.
Asakusa has a lot of culture, like Kaminari-mon.
He's in the park with Hasuo.
Read it for me.
Please get my note from the kitchen table.
Then go wash your face.
We need these things for dinner.
Onions Carrots Potatoes Chicken Spice mix
Are you shopping for dinner?
The kids are tired of New Year's dishes.
Daffodil is lost, too!
The sign says... Aka... sa... ka... Mi...
Can I walk to Kaminari-mon from here?
That's in Asakusa, not Akasaka.
Where are the ticket machines?
They're over there on the right.
Is this your first time in Japan?
Well... it's my first time in five years.
Put in 200 yen... and....
Go down these stairs.
Thank you so much.
I'm on my way to Asakusa now!
Her phone is off!
I can't even walk!
Are you looking for Kaminari-mon?
Why yes, I am!
The main temple is down there.
Go through Kaminari-mon and walk straight.
In front of the temple you can see a big incense burner.
Well, my left knee hurts a little.
The pain is gone!
You're waiting for your friend, right?
How do you know that?!
I put some smoke on my head!
We can wait and shop.
I like these masks.
My grandson loves masks.
I'm with my new friend.
Who are talking about?
I don't see her.
Anyway, what do you have in that bag?
I have a mask for my grandson.
I want some sweets for Sakura.
Ask me anything about Asakusa!
May I help you?
Oh, you speak good English!
We have a lot of foreign customers here.
They're dorayaki, sweet red bean pancakes.
They are very good.
Give me six of them.
Go to the shop six doors down.
What are you doing?
Is my mom in Asakusa?
Don't be late for dinner!
I had that for lunch!
Let me tell you tonight's bedtime story.
Tell me about Daffodil's new friend.
She was so kind, but she disappeared.
You mean the lady in the white dress?
Go wash your face!
I want square toast!
Are you still dreaming?
Mine is always a triangle!
Never say "He like winter."
Say "He likes winter."
Yes, he likes, she likes...
Don't eat, read and talk!
Is Hasuo always like this?
Who is he talking to?
He's talking to his best friend, Umeo.
Hasuo is his English tutor.
Hasuo is such a nice boy.
See you at school, Umeo!
Mom, can I have Hasuo's egg?
I'm not a horse!
Of course you're not a horse, honey.
You're my little angel.
You're pure and sweet.
Hasuo's book is still on the table!
Taro gets up at six thirty every day.
He eats breakfast at seven.
He goes to school.
He comes home and does his homework.
He takes a bath after dinner, watches TV, and goes to bed.
Well... Taro gets up and...
What's this page about?
You can do it, Umeo!
It's about... Taro's... TV!
Umeo is trying hard!
Can you help him, Hasuo?
That's all for today!
See you tomorrow, class!
Open your textbooks to page 67.
You have one minute.
What's that page about?
You both did so well!
Let's have a quiz on this page tomorrow!
Reading is so hard!
You did a good job.
Let's study together at your house!
I don't feel like it.
See you tomorrow... maybe.
I'm fine, but tomatoes and potatoes are both vegetables.
They're vegetables, all right.
Anyway, what's up, Ayame?
My brother is upset.
Can you help him?
You smell like lemons.
Go get a lemon from the fridge.
Maybe I have one!
Here's a nice, fresh lemon for you.
Thank you, Dream Spirit.
Give it to Hasuo tomorrow morning, and tell him this...
Goodnight and good luck!
I have some magic for you today!
It's a magic lemon!
How does it work?
... help your focus and memory!
Does it really work?
Now open your textbook...
Umeo got a perfect score on his quiz yesterday!
He also studied very hard.
I have some magic for you, too.
Oh, I see Grandma Daisy!
What are you thinking about?
Oh, do you really?
You're thinking about the flower garden!
And I made up my mind yesterday!
Grandma made up her mind...
Yes... but before that...
What color is your dress?
Those pancakes smell good!
I love pancakes, but... no toppings?
What's in this bowl?
They look really good, but... what's special about them?
We have the same thing at the café.
I know, but this third bowl is full of magic!
You put maple syrup on them, right?
I put this on top.
Why did you make pancakes for us?
Oh, I see now.
The pancakes were your goodbye present, right?
Did you like them?
We'll miss you, Daffodil.
Thank you for everything, Chrys.
I'll miss them, too.
What do you mean by that?
Nobody knows about this yet, but...
Oh, a call from Daisy!
You finished your call?
I spilled the beans to Daisy.
Well, here we are at the airport.
I want some sleep!
Oh, you're pink again!
What's on your mind?
You did something before kindergarten, right?
Daffodil went back to San Francisco!
I didn't say "What's next?"
I said "Who's next?"
Grandma Daisy, I guess.
Why are you laughing?
I love her so much!
So... what did you do?
Now I can always be with her!
Tell me about your father.
I love him very much!
What did he do today?
What is he doing?
A lot of things.
Oh, don't go, Dream Spirit!
Do you want square toast?
Look at these photos!
Not just cherry blossoms, but very special ones!
So many "special" things this month!
How are you, Sakura?
What are you looking at?
Pink... kind, pink heart...
You wanted to tell me this?!
Don't talk to yourself, Sakura.
Can I tell the kids now?
We'll move to America next month!
What about my friends?
Is that our new house?
Your father grew up here.
Grandma looked at me....
My kind, pink heart saved her...
Let's go to kindergarten together!
Hi... what do you have in your hand?
Where are you from, Mom?
Tonight's bedtime story is from... America!
I was twenty years old.
How old are you, Sakura?
Yes, eighteen years ago.
I was born in April, so my name is Daisy!
How are you this morning?
This is hot water, Chrys!
You can see them, but they can't hear you, Sakura.
Do you have classes today, kids?
Have a good day!
Are you worried about your mom?
Your grandmother is very sick, Sakura...
Get well soon, Grandma Daisy!
Still sleepy, Cherry Pit?
He's in the shower.
You're late for school!
Eat your eggs and go!
See you later, guys!
"A" and "N" and "T."
Do you remember Grandma Daisy, Cherry?
Well... where is she now?
She lives far away.
Grandma Daisy loves you very much, Sakura!
Can you spell "love?"
A bedtime story about Grandma Daisy?
Oh, my little cherry blossom!
It's your name in English.
Look at the flowers, Mom!
My eyesight is bad.
They're cherry blossoms, Daisy.
Their name is sakura in Japanese!
How are you today?
Thanks to my Sakura!
I'm so happy, Mom!
Don't forget my Sakura!
Daisy is well now.
Jealousy is the enemy, Sakura.
Wait until next month...
How do you know that?!
Hasuo's toast is a square!
Don't be jealous, Sakura!
I like square toast!
I want square toast, too!
You can have two triangles, Sakura.
I want three squares!
Jealousy is the enemy?
No dream last night...
I'm on a diet!
You count those steps with Fukuta, right?
We count the steps!
Cherry Pit has a boyfriend!
Sometimes, I walk with Momo.
You walk with Momo?!
I have a question, Momo.
Sakura... you're not very funny...
Are you OK, Sakura?
Let's play a game!
Momo is here now.
Is eight o'clock all right?
Why are you here, Momo?
Don't listen to your father, Fukuta!
Time to go home, Momo!
See you tomorrow, Momo!
Is Sakura all right?
I'm worried about her.
Maybe she's jealous of Fukuta and Momo.
Oh, it's nine already!
Let's go to your room.
I want my green pajamas!
Do you have a problem with kindergarten?
Green is my favorite color, you know.
I don't like green!
I don't like kindergarten!
Say hi to Fukuta... and his pretty girlfriend, Momo!
Tonight, your bedtime story is about... a peach!
The sound changes a lot!
How do you know...?
You can't win, Sakura!
But Momo isn't a bad girl!
A peach is pink, too!
So... does Fukuta like cherries or peaches?
I can find out!!
Momo has no father.
Her mother works late.
But... Fukuta likes Momo.
Fukuta's mom looks after Momo.
Like mother, like son.
You and Momo are both Fukuta's friends.
You can share his friendship.
Because "cherry" and "peach" both have "CH"!
Today, let's talk about fruit.
What are your favorite fruits, Fukuta?
I like Sakura and Momo!
I like Sakura and Momo, too!
See you tomorrow, kids!
I like your pink ribbon!
Pink Sakura and pink Momo!
Does Momo have a song?
Don't be jealous, Momo!
Clean your room, Hasuo!
Give me a break, Dad!
Oh, a message from your friend.
Don't stay up too late!
I study late every night!
What's wrong with that?!
Hasuo is so noisy!
Anyway, tonight's bedtime story is...
Hasuo... is he OK?
What's tonight's bedtime story?
She works so hard every day.
Tonight's storyteller is... me!
Your stories aren't very interesting....
Tell me about Hasuo!
He has midterms this month.
Teachers give you questions.
Like... "where are you from?"
Hasuo is so noisy!
He studies a lot of subjects.
English, science, social studies, math...
I can count to ten!
Green Dream Spirit again?!
Why am I in Hasuo's room?
I have some questions!
Umeo calls and Hasuo gets angry.
Umeo just gets in the way of Hasuo's studies?
You're mean... and green!
You... you're not green!
Napoleon was born in 1769.
Where was he born?
He was born in France!
Can you count in English?
What's twenty-five plus thirty-six?
Matsuda Denjuro was born in 1769, too.
He was born in...
He was born in Echigo!
Can you come to my house after school?
We have cherries and blueberries.
I can study with you for thirty minutes.
You can't say no to fruit!
I'm here for him this month.
You can help him?
She goes to our school.
Anyway, where are the blueberries?
What are your questions?
Teach me these English words.
Bite your lip like this.
Don't bite it too hard.
Yeah, I'm very busy.
I want bacon, too!
That's the last piece.
Oh, it's time for school!
He's still mean... and weak.
Not "sahti purasu shix."
It's "thirty plus six."
Anyway, what's thirty plus six?
You can go back to your seat.
I'm sad about today's English test.
Don't look at me like that!
Next time, study hard!
I need a good teacher.
How about your sister?
She's always busy... like you.
Are you sleepy, Mom?
Tonight's bedtime story is about....
All right, but why?
He's so quiet tonight.
He's tired after all his tests.
I need a good teacher...
I can't forget his eyes!
Are you free tomorrow?
I can be your teacher.
My brother is now strong and...
Come on in, Mr. Rose!
You have a teacher, and I have a good friend!
This is my best friend, Hasuo!
Nice to meet you.
Oh, that beautiful voice....
And this beautiful blue moon...
Nice to meet you...
You're a good student!
I have a good teacher!
Can you come to my house tomorrow after tennis practice?
My leg is broken!
Turn your ankle slowly.
It's just a sprain.
Are you OK, Umeo?!
Hasuo, the moon is silver.
I can carry him on my back!
He just has a backache.
Give him a massage, Sakura.
Tonight's bedtime story is about... the blue moon!
How do you know, Mom?!
What's the blue moon?
What's the blue moon?
Can you see it?
The moon is silver.
But for Hasuo, it's blue.
His heart is blue, too.
I'm light blue... almost white... and I'm sad... like Hasuo.
Pass me the salt, Sakura.
You never ask about your hairstyle!
You look fine, Hasuo!
I want square toast, Mom!
See you later, guys!
What's wrong with him?
We don't have tennis practice today.
I still have a backache.
Let's go to the gym!
Ayame has volleyball practice there.
Her big game is tomorrow!
We can go home!
I'm free all day!
Ayame is a great player!
I'm proud of her!
You can beat Ajisai Junior High for sure!
Your face is red!
Is that English or math?
You don't have anything on your desk!
See you at home tonight, Umeo!
What do you mean "Have fun"?
She has a date!
He's sad, but you can cheer him up.
Take him to the park.
Let's go to the park tomorrow.
Someone takes care of that cat every day....
What do you see, Hasuo?
It's fresh and warm...
Dream Spirit, what is it?
What color are you?
I can't see you.
You're too far away...
Sunflower likes that girl.
Mom, your pancakes are delicious!
I use salt-free butter.
It doesn't have much taste...
And I use sunflower oil.
Can I have another piece, Mom?
You're on a diet, right?
No gold stars for you!
Just a second, girls.
Momo, what's that smell?
You have a good nose, Sakura.
The smell is from Mom's pancakes.
Botan is a fast runner!
Can't you read the sign?
Let's go home, Hasuo!
Umeo, let's follow Botan!
I don't see a "WANTED" sign!
Just come with me!
I can't run anymore!
I can't drink this water!
Open your mouth and drink it!
Umeo, you can still drink it.
Look at the sign next to the SAVE WATER sign.
Do you see Botan?
Why do you care so much?
She's like my tutor.
She's not in the park.
I don't see any sunflowers.
You want the girl with the cat, right?
Fresh and warm... Hawaii...
Yeah, she's a stray cat.
Botan takes care of her.
Is Botan with the cat?
We're on the other side of the hill.
Which way is Triangle Park?
Then walk straight for a while, and...
About... ten blocks or so.
Where IS Triangle Park?
Maybe we're still lost.
I see a cat under that tree.
Don't wake her up.
He can't find Botan...
He has all the clues...
fresh and warm... Hawaii...
Ask your parents tomorrow...
Do they know something?
What's fresh, warm, and orange in Hawaii?
They're pink, yellow, red, and white flowers from Hawaii!
I don't see Sunflower, Hasuo.
I remember this garden.
So many hibiscus flowers!
Dream Spirit, you are great!
I hear... a cat.
I'm here for you.
You care about others.
Hibiscus flowers are pretty, but your heart is beautiful, Botan.
Her heart is orange.
Why are you here?
Your heart is orange!
It's fresh and warm.
She is so angry.
Why doesn't she like me...?
What is your name?
My name is Sakura.
I'm five years old.
You talk too much!
Are you children hungry?
I have some fruit and sweets in the kitchen.
That man is a stranger.
I'm not a dangerous man.
He's the chair of the town council.
His name is Yonehara Manjuro.
Not manju, but Manjuro.
Anyway, I'll call your families.
Thank you, Mr. Yonehara.
This sofa is huge!
Just a second, children.
What's in that teacup?!
Cute... cute... little dog...
She's a present from Asagao!
She is my friend.
Mr. Yonehara's name is Manjuro.
That's my late wife.
She died twenty years ago.
Dad, he has a dog in a cup!
Is it a teacup poodle?
It's a preset from his friend, Asagao.
He has a granddaughter, too.
Her name is Sumire.
She lives in America with her mother.
Tonight's bedtime story is...
What's on your hat?
Is it a star?
It's not a star.
It's a morning glory.
Nice to see you again, Mr. Yonehara.
Nice to see you again, too.
Sakura is like Sumire.
So, Sakura can help me.
Tonight's bedtime story is about...
Asagao and Mr. Manju!
Mr. Yonehara is in trouble, and you can help him.
Look at this flower.
So smooth and delicate...
Asagao is a gentle and delicate lady...
Good evening, Mr. Yonehara.
Asagao will like you, too.
Are you ready, Sakura?
She's angry at me now, but you can help.
Why is she angry?
Because I often work with a woman.
Her name is Kiku.
We work together for this town.
Asagao doesn't like it.
I don't like walking.
Just three more minutes.
We're almost at the station.
Not very good, because you're always busy.
I'm with someone special today.
Well, aren't you cute?!
I want a strawberry shake!
Look at those pictures, Sakura!
Which do you want, cheesecake or apple pie?
Give me two pieces of cheesecake, please.
You like Kiku, right?
We just work together.
I only have eyes for you, Asagao.
I swear to... Sakura!
You mean that man in the gray suit?
Yes, but he doesn't look happy...
He's in his little, square office.
Now listen to him carefully...
What time is it?
How do I tell Tsubaki...?
What time is it?
Don't you have a watch?!
My watch is broken.
But it's the perfect time for dinner!
We're very busy with our project, right, Mr. Aoi?
Can I have a large curry and rice, please?
Maybe some more curry and rice...
It's already ten twenty-eight.
You can go now.
Whose bag is this?
Take it easy, Boss!
I'm very proud of you!
You're an excellent manager.
We need an excellent manager at the new factory.
It opens in two months.
I'm not tired, but...
But you're worried about Fukuta's father, right?
I see a circle of dark shadow around his heart...
She has a cold.
He's fifty-two years old.
Not how old, I mean... is your dad OK?
Tonight's bedtime story is...
What do you mean?
His hair is gray?
Not his hair, Mom.
His heart is gray.
It's another wonderful day!
Anyway, it's time for a coffee break.
Get back to your desk and work on the presentation!
All work and no play....
How long does it take to Brazil?
Oh, it's so far.
I just have some papers.
By the way, are you ready for the presentation?
Your heart is already in Brazil?
I can't wait, but...
Tanaka, the 2nd Division Chief, can finish it for you.
But my team needs me.
Give us one more month.
Tanaka can do it.
Do you really think so...?
It's pretty cold today.
I like warm weather.
But I don't like tropical weather.
Um... anyway, your English is very good now!
Thank you, but I don't know any other languages...
Sentaro is so strange.
I don't understand him.
Why don't you understand him?
Company people sometimes change their workplace.
Let's go to Fukuta's house!
You're early today, Sakura!
You don't like the transfer?
How do you know that, Sakura?
Well... Brazil is so far...
Oh, I'm so happy!
It's in South America!
Oh, I need a dance teacher!
I can dance in the parade!
My heart is gray now.
Now I can't go!
I have a friend in Brazil.
He works at a travel agency, too.
That's too late for the...
We're at my neighbor's house.
Is December 23rd all right with you, Tsubaki?
Sentaro, what do you think?
About seven hours to Honolulu.
Is that your phone?
I know, but I can't answer it now.
The last three numbers are 5-4-8?
Thank you for calling.
I have a big surprise for Sakura!
A phone call for you!
It's a telephone message.
The message is from...
By the way, who's Daffodil?
You don't know her, but she knows you...
Why are you... red and green?
Perfect colors for Christmas...
Let's make greeting cards today!
Good morning is a greeting, but we have other greetings, too.
Everyone, take a card.
To the post office!
We send them from the post office to someone special.
Put a "T" here, like this!
My shape is... a pink heart!
What's your shape, Fukuta?
Look at this, Mom!
Is that for me?
It's for Grandma Daisy!
It's my big surprise for Grandma!!!
That's so sweet, Sakura...
Can we go to the post office and send it?
A pink heart again, Sakura?
What's that shape on your New Year's card?
And why is it white?
They're for New Year's!
We eat square ones, too!
We eat... circles and squares... at New Year's?
And you can toast them!
We put them in soup, too!
Would you like the beef or the chicken?
Then, the chicken, please.
My first family reunion in five years!
This is my first trip to Japan!
Which would you like, green tea or black tea?
Black tea with cream and sugar for me, please.
We only have one size for hot drinks.
He's on his way.
What would you like?
Ginger ale for me, please!
How about some red wine?
Red is a Christmas color, right?
Three glasses of red wine, please.
Your father and two special guests.
Thanks for waiting, everybody!
I have a special Christmas present for you!
Oh, I'm so happy!
Thank you for the beautiful Christmas card, dear!
Are you ready to order, sir?
The roast turkey is tonight's special.
Look at that gorgeous Christmas tree!
Let's take a photo!
Don't tickle me, Fukuta!
Fukuta's hand is on mine!
Put some waterproof glue around the hole.
Then we fit in this round piece of glass.
I'm checking the bottom for gaps.
This is a very important job.
We can't have any holes.
You're like my dad.
I'm checking the oars.
What color do you want for the body, Mech?
An indigo submarine... with pink caps...
Indigo is a good color.
My best friend from way back.
Where is he now?
Anyway, we need three big cans of indigo paint.
What did you say?
Lolan has a friend in the sea.
Is that friend a fish?
He was a master coconut grower.
He taught Lolan everything.
Are you OK, Grandpa?
Nice to meet you!
Where are you from?
I'm from this island!
Oh, your finger is...
Grandpa Lolan's best friend.
Yes, for twenty years.
And this island is...
Like salt and pepper?
You're a poet, son.
No sunsets in the city?
They are Mo's dinner.
Take Mech to school.
It's his first day!
No school for me today.
This is our new student, Mech.
I'm from Jam City.
You're a city boy!
Yes, I'm from the city.
My favorite subject is math.
You're good at math, right?
Mr. Ponder, please tell us.
Let's sing a song in English!
How about the ABC song?
Just relax and try.
Mom, I miss you.
Your letter is... so warm.
Is your grandpa nice to you?
Here's a drawing from Angel.
She's on... a dolphin?!
She's on the dolphin's nose!
Is that a ribbon?
I'm late for school!
She's in the sea with Dolphy.
Is that her name?
Dolphy is Finfy's boyfriend.
By the way, I have water for you, Lolan.
Here's a dime for the water.
What's this word, Finfy?
This is "k-nock", right?
"K" and "N" together are [n].
So K-N-I-F-E is "nife"!
Oh, that's a good smell!
So this is "photo" and "elephant!"
Put the plates on the table, kids!
Get another one from the cage, Finfy.
It's an important food for people here.
Are you OK, Mech?
Yes, I'm OK now.
Let's go tomorrow, after school.
It's a beautiful night.
Are you scared, Mech?
Maybe... a bat or... a snake.
It's a cute one!
It's on your pants.
We're in the dark, so we can see their light well.
Send this phone to Mech.
Here's a solar battery.
Can I talk to Angel?
Angel, your brother wants you.
Sing a song for me, Angel!
One, two, buckle my shoe.
You're a good singer!
Three, four, knock on the door.
Five, six, pick up sticks.
Say hi to Grandpa for us!
One, two, buckle my shoe...
Three, four, knock on the door.
Is that a cell phone?
Let's take a walk!
You stay home all day.
That's not good for you.
I like smart AND strong people.
Let's go swimming today!
But I can't swim!
Dolphy can help you, too!
Of course it's wet.
I don't have a swimsuit!
Those shorts are fine!
I don't want the water's love!
The water isn't his friend yet.
How about Pepper Island...
Chicken is very expensive.
We need the eggs, too.
I love fried bananas!
Only bananas for dinner?
Come with me, Mech.
Let's fry bananas together!
Do we have any dessert?
We have fresh bananas!
Can I go with you?
Can you find water?
Do you like bugs?
What's the third question, Dad?
He loves nature, so nature loves him.
I have some sunflower seeds.
He's in the woods.
Maybe... he's in the coconut field.
What do you use that toolbox for?
This is for my canoe.
The outrigger has a crack.
Long time no see!
I can hear you now.
Your dad's new book is great!
I can go to the museum every day.
So you can meet all those bugs there, right?
Come to Pepper Island!
It's full of bugs!
I can come on Monday.
He loves bugs, the woods...
Well, I can teach him more about nature.
Let's do survival training together!
Welcome to Pepper Island!
These are my friends, Finfy and Skippy.
For your survival training.
It's a camping trip.
Do you have sleeping bags?
"Listen to nature, and learn!"
What do you have?
We have two sleeping bags, rice, and...
Five bottles of water in these bags.
In the sea, of course!
This is so exciting!
I'm a good diver, too!
Yeah, life is but a dream...
Life is only a dream...
Remember your dad's question?
Do you like bugs?
Can I find many bugs there?
Oh, we don't have a tent!
I see a hut.
Collect dry wood and leaves!
Fires are very important.
You can do that.
Just keep an eye on that fire!
Oh, so many bugs...
And... I like you, Oliver.
Come to Jam City someday!
Have a safe trip!
Do you remember Lolan's toolbox?
I see... a wooden dolphin?!
He's under it with his toolbox!
I can't see any fins on it.
It's not a toy.
Then... what is it?
You sleep in it.
But he has a bed at home!
He can sleep in a dolphin!
I don't think so.
I can't sleep in small spaces like that.
It's just a hammock with a roof!
Hey, Lolan isn't in the cabin!
On this small island?
Actually, it's a pretty big island.
Well, it's already late.
What's that wooden dolphin?
Do you need help with math?
And... English, social studies, science, and...
I can help you.
After that, let's find out Lolan's secret!
Let's go to the cabin!
We don't have the keys!
Skippy can handle it.
What do you see?
Grandpa, let's go to Jam City and meet Angel!
Sorry, but I can't go.
Let me ask Tom.
Say hi to everybody for me!
Thank you, Captain Tom.
Have a nice day!
Where's the hardware store?
Can we finally meet Angel?
Excuse me, but how can I get to this store?
Then walk two more blocks, and turn right.
Where's the hardware store?
Yes, and turn right....
Jam City is too big for me!
Show me those receipts.
They're all from the same shop.
It has two H's on it!
Hi, may I help you?
We have some receipts from this shop.
What is... this item?
Rubber products are on Aisle 3.
Can you remember anything from Lolan's cabin?
The dolphin has a small hole on the side.
And I remember rubber on the floor.
Look at the next receipt, Finfy.
A small hole, rubber... and waterproof glue....
What does Lolan use it for?
Press the button there.
The next stop is ours.
I can finally meet Angel!
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Ponder...
How far is it?
Is this all your building?!
My condo's on the top floor.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Ponder.
Come to the door, Angel!
Your brother is back!
Aren't you hungry, Mech?
I can fix you some cheese spaghetti.
It's normal in Jam City, Skippy.
Milo, your store is never busy.
To my secret cabin.
Just come with me.
What's this blue thing?
It looks like a dolphin.
Let's carry it to Strawberry Beach.
What are you up to?
What can I do for you now?
Tie the Lucy One to that canoe.
Let go of the rope, but stay with me.
I open this hole, and the water comes in.
Tell me about your life on Pepper Island.
I swim with Dolphy every day.
I carry water to Lolan every day.
How about you, Mech?
He studies all day.
He's good at math, but he can't swim!
How are classes at school, Mech?
Oliver goes to a cram school every night.
What do you mean?
He needs friends like Oliver.
Look at him now.
He's very strong and confident.
Maybe lizard steak is good for him!
Oh, I'm hungry and thirsty!
What time is it, Mech?
Let's go to this burger shop.
Look at this menu, Finfy!
And one children's meal for Angel.
Twenty-nine dollars and twenty cents, please.
Eyes and ears and mouth and nose.
You're a good singer, but finish your fries now.
You already know my name!
This hat is perfect for Lolan.
What time is your boat tomorrow, Mech?
Let's keep Mech for the weekend.
I open this hole, and the water comes in.
Now Lucy, we dive... for the first time!
I'm on my way!
Can you hear me?
Let me open the hatch for you!
Let me push your chest!
I'm already in bed.
Where are you now?
Say hi to Lolan for me!
Back to Pepper Island!
Don't you miss Angel?
I miss your mom's cheese spaghetti.
I can cook it for you anytime.
I have a question, Mech!
What is Lolan's project?
We have enough clues.
It's a new type of canoe.
A canoe with a hole on the side?
A new type of canoe?
Do you know the rumor about the standing dolphin?
Is it still a secret?
I sometimes spend hours here.
You mean in the coconut field, right?
Yes, but how long does that job take?
This is my lab!
This is another wooden dolphin!
It's a special boat, right?
It goes under the water.
The Lucy Two is a submarine... almost.
You're good at math and science.
It's not a map?!
By the way, who is Lucy?
Well, that's a long story.
Keep it short, Grandpa!
Lucy is my late wife.
Why is she late?
I can still hear her voice.
Finish your homework before supper!
Just give me thirty minutes.
But no homework, no supper!
It's not so bad.
Go to Jam City and study.
Jam City has many schools, Sage.
You can always grow coconuts later.
Excuse me, but what about the submarine?
Back to the Lucy One.
Water only fills the tail....
We need partition boards!
It's about 50 centimeters deep.
The Lucy One only has one big tank.
But add two boards... and the water goes into each tank at the same time.
How can we get the water into the tanks?
We need two valves for each tank.
How big are the valves?
Maybe 10 centimeters, so the tanks fill up fast!
We can put a spring in each valve.
How do we close the valves?
Let's connect the caps with wire!
I can't answer the phone right now.
Then call your mom.
No, but she's always busy...
We need four springs and...
Oh, my memory is not very good lately.
What else do we need?
Zibby's phone can't run away!
Where can I find the items on this shopping list?
Sorry, we're out of stock now.
What's your name, angel?
Her name is Angel.
Can I order springs of this size?
No, let me pay now.
So four springs, shipping, plus tax.
Oh, I also need thin wire.
We're out of wire, too.
Do you have anything in stock?
Well... we have Christmas cards!
Did you bring a package for me?
One for me, Mech, Skippy, and Finfy!
I finished the blueprints!
Call Finfy and Skippy!
We were behind those trees.
Don't scare me like that!
A Christmas card from Angel!
Your hands are shaking!
Let me open it.
Look at this picture!
Now we're ready for the Lucy Two!
Mech, we have a Christmas cake from Milo.
First, let's sing a song!
Ron is your chef today.
I recommend the tai sashimi.
Japanese people eat it for good luck.
Do you want some more meat?
You know shabu-shabu very well.
I'm studying about Japanese food for my next film.
Cash or credit card?
Hey, Ron, you have a very nice voice.
Alice is a casting director.
How was your winter break, Jake?
Then we climbed a mountain on New Year's Eve.
The top of the mountain was very far.
How was your break, Saya?
Our team lost 2 to 1.
But your goal was important.
How about you, Noriaki?
I practiced every day.
Oh, did you practice your lines for the next play?
No, it's something else.
No, it's not sumo!
Is it ice hockey?
I practiced ice skating.
Maybe you can go to the Olympics!
Umm... I'm just a beginner.
I can only walk on the ice.
I got up at five.
I had a great dream.
What was the dream about?
In the dream, I passed the video audition for the Hollywood film.
I sent it last month.
And you're still waiting for the result.
I dream about it every night.
Well, you had a good dream this morning.
Today is the 25th, but in Hollywood it's the 24th.
Maybe it's from Hollywood!
I passed the video audition!
The next step is a face-to-face audition.
I need a lot of practice.
Can you help me, Ron?
The role is a Japanese chef.
What is that noise?
It's coming from the bushes.
Oh, look, it's a cat!
We found a cat.
She looks hungry and weak.
We can't leave her here, Dad.
It's windy and cold outside.
Let's take her home and feed her.
She eats a lot, just like Saya!
Look at her cute face.
Dad, can we keep her?
Sure, but let's ask your mom, too.
What a cute cat!
She ate a lot of food.
So Mom, can we keep her?
I can feed her and clean her toilet every day.
Take good care of your little sister.
Let's think of a cool name.
But Tiger sounds strong.
It's a good name.
She's a small, cute cat.
Tiger is not a very good name for her.
She's black, and nori is black, too.
Oh, how about "Sushi," then?
And "Toro" is a good name, too.
We're thinking of a cat's name.
Are you still thinking of the cat's name?
How did you choose our names, Dad?
Your mom and I looked at your faces.
We thought, "She is Saya," and, "He is Kota"!
Then let's do the same.
Let's look at her face.
How does she look?
She's sleeping and smiling.
Your name is Happy!
But I got one mysterious chocolate.
I found it in my mailbox.
It was a handmade chocolate.
Someone likes you very much!
Was it from you, Saya?
I don't make chocolate.
I only eat chocolate.
Who gave that chocolate to me?
I got a chocolate in a red bag, too.
It was in the shape of an "N."
"N" is my initial!
Actually, guys, the chocolates were from me.
I made a mistake.
So the S-shaped chocolate was for Saya, not from Saya.
In America, boys give gifts to their friends on Valentine's Day, too.
Now I can eat the chocolate.
Uh... can I keep the "S"?
Your character is a Japanese chef.
He is also an action hero.
Can you read this line?
Now tell us about yourself.
Can you do some action moves?
Tommy, what color is your judo belt?
I don't have a belt.
I learned judo in high school.
So you have very little experience.
Well, that's all for this audition.
Sorry I'm late, guys.
What are you doing here?
I'm the casting director of this movie.
Tommy, what can you show us?
I can cut an apple in the air.
What can I do for you?
We are making an English ad for this soy sauce.
We use it at Sakaki.
Yes, but it's not famous in the U.S. yet.
I have some ideas.
The first one is, "Don't cook Japanese food without this!"
How about, Do you have a new chef?
No, we have a new soy sauce.
It's good, but it's long.
Both ideas are good.
But you need an elegant image for the product.
Dad is a good writer.
His letters to my mom are like poetry.
How about this one?
That's too big for me.
What kind of bag are you looking for?
It's very stylish, Jake.
I like this red pencil case.
I want one, too.
That's a nice color.
Actually, I like the green one, too.
I have three of them.
Then let's all get the same one.
You are my guests today.
I can't believe it.
It was smooth and delicious.
But you worked really hard.
We had a great time.
What is it, Dad?
Our restaurant is going to open in the summer.
These flowers are for you.
Oh... thank you, guys.
Are you crying, Jake?
No... no, I'm not.
OK, let's go home!
Where are you from?
Nice to meet you, Saya!
Nice to meet you, Jake.
This is my father.
This is my first day of school.
Nice to meet you.
This is my brother Kota.
My name is Kota.
Where are you from?
Do you live together?
My address is 12 Wakaba-cho.
You are lucky, Jake!
The English Drama Club sounds cool.
We have only ten members.
You can choose your uniform number.
It's my favorite number.
That's a good number.
Welcome to the soccer club!
This year we have two new members!
Welcome to our house!
Wow, your house is nice.
Is your dad in the kitchen?
This is a great picture.
Is this your mom?
Her eyes are beautiful.
I miss my mom.
Oh, a tatami room.
This is a big poster!
Is he your grandfather?
He is my hero.
Dad's nikujaga is so good.
Is this my plate?
This is your plate.
This salad is so good.
I'm glad you like it.
Is this your original recipe?
My mom is a great cook, too!
You can open a restaurant!
This Thursday is Mom's birthday.
Um, how about an English play?
Tommy, you can say, "Yoko, I'm a lucky man. You are beautiful."
I can't do it!
OK, I can say, "You're active."
And you can say, "You are my everything."
And say, "I love you!"
Yoko, I'm a lucky man.
You are beautiful and active.
You are my everything.
I... love... I love... I am Tomio.
It's a beautiful day today!
My restaurant has a sugidama.
It's a big ball.
Oh, I see it!
Welcome to my restaurant, Sakaki.
This is Mr. Sakaki.
He is the owner of this restaurant.
Nice to meet you.
And this is my wife.
Is it an iris?
This cup is beautiful.
What's this green vegetable?
Is it a bean?
No, it's a saya daikon.
It's Ura... shima... Taro.
Is he young or old?
Well, he is young and old.
What do you mean?
"Come to Ryugu-jo with me."
You can meet Otohime-sama.
"She is a beautiful princess."
I have big news.
A commercial director needs an English-speaking actor.
Oh, this is a big chance for me!
Here is the map.
Studio 305 is on the third floor.
Where is the elevator?
Oh, Jake, this is Studio 304.
Studio 305 is next door.
Wow, this is a big studio.
Excuse me, where is the director?
Ms. Hirai is in rehearsal.
And Dad is in front of the camera.
Welcome to the studio!
What is Tommy's role?
And what are his lines?
Ah, that's an easy line.
Dad, are you OK?
So, what is your line?
Where is my restroom?
It's "Where is the restroom?"
Where is your confidence?
Saya, are you free next Saturday?
I'm free on Sunday.
I'm not very good at soccer....
How about a movie?
Action, horror or romance?
I like horror movies.
Yeah, it looks like a good film.
Sure, but romantic movies are boring.
OK, then let's watch the action movie.
Where are our seats?
Our seats are in the middle.
You can sit next to her, Noriaki.
I can sit in the middle.
OK, guys, let's order.
I'll have orange juice.
How about you, Saya?
But I'll have a hamburger, fries, a hot dog and a large salad.
Saya, you really are powerful.
How are you, Jake?
OK, let's do that!
It's evening in Los Angeles now.
My classmates are friendly and nice.
I'm so glad to hear that.
But you look tired.
Yes, I am tired.
They can now say, "Okawari."
Say hi to your brother, girls!
Oh, your sisters are so cute!
Uh... Saya is a good friend.
It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too, Saya!
Thanks for your help today, kids.
It's for the tatami room of the restaurant.
Let's add a picture!
What is the sign for?
It's for the office.
Where is the office?
It's by the restroom.
Next up is the English menu.
And, "Do not use your oshibori to wipe your body."
What is this sign?
Is it for Sakaki?
It's for you, Saya!
OK, it's time for some dessert and TV.
I'm ready for Hollywood!
Saya, are you ready for your debut tomorrow?
Yes, your first soccer game is tomorrow.
Before you go, Saya, I have a surprise for you.
It's a victory bento.
Have a good game!
Look at their team.
Well, their coach is famous.
Our team can't win.
Hey, you can do it!
It's my first festival in Japan.
Oh, it's almost time for Bon Odori.
What is Bon Odori?
I dance Bon Odori every year.
Can I dance it, too?
I like the design!
Oh, but is it a bit small?
That is a small size.
Do you have a medium size?
Let's dance Bon Odori together.
Bon Odori is easy, Ron.
But I don't have a yukata.
You can borrow one there!
I want something cold.
Yay, I love kakigori!
I like all the flavors.
I mix them together.
I don't like kakigori.
I get a headache!
What are your plans for summer vacation?
I can't think about it.
It's too hot here!
I recommend the Kazahana Highlands.
It's cool and dry there.
A lot of people go there.
My grandparents live in the Kazahana Highlands.
I go there every summer.
We climb Mt. Kazahana.
The air is fresh and the flowers are beautiful.
My dad has no time for summer vacation.
Come with me to the Kazahana Highlands!
You can come, too, Noriaki.
Thanks, but I have summer school.
Jake is very excited about the trip.
Saya's grandparents are excited, too.
How do you know?
Our family is originally from there.
The water is so clear.
Wow, I can see my feet!
Let's catch that fish.
Kids, it's time for some watermelon!
Dry your hands and eat a lot!
The wind feels nice!
My back and legs hurt!
Are you tired already, Jake?
OK, let's take a break.
Do you climb this mountain often?
Yes, I run to the top every day.
That is the famous sunset.
The sunset here is always beautiful.
This is my favorite place.
Oh no, my stomach!
Who's ready for dinner?
But it's very hot!
I want more tempura.
OK, but leave some room in your stomach.
We have a birthday cake for you!
Summer vacation is over.
Morning practice starts next week.
Practice for the undokai.
What is an undokai?
It's a sports day.
So, what do you do on the sports day?
We have relays and play games like tsunahiki.
Oh, that's "tug of war" in English.
We have concerts and theater performances.
Does the English Drama Club also perform?
Every year our club performs a play.
It's still a secret.
Tsukimi is a traditional event in Japan.
My dad makes good tsukimi udon.
The egg on the udon is like the full moon.
Don't forget tsukimi dango!
Jake, that carrot looks like a flower.
He practices every day at home and at the restaurant.
My dad has a lot of tasks at Sakaki.
What does he do?
He also cleans the restaurant.
Ron is a professional chef.
He says, "Cleaning is an important part of omotenashi."
Tommy is a good cook, too.
What does he do during the day?
Wow, he's a super homemaker... and an actor.
My dad goes jogging every day.
Yes, but he doesn't mind it.
Tommy is always happy.
And he entertains everyone.
And his jokes are funny.
Your dad has many talents!
May I have your name?
I'm Yoko's husband, Tommy.
Dad is on TV!
What do you do, Alice?
I'm a casting director for Hollywood films.
It's so good to see you.
Tommy, Saya and Kota are wonderful hosts.
That's great to hear.
By the way, what is this good smell?
Please visit us again.
Let's keep in touch.
See you in Hollywood someday!
Where are you now?
Are you still at school?
We have a big group of customers at Sakaki tonight.
I can't make dinner.
Is Jake at your place?
He has English Drama Club practice today.
OK, so what is your message?
Please tell Jake, "I can't make dinner tonight."
Please tell Jake, "I can't make dinner tonight."
Oh, he can have dinner with us.
Thank you so much.
This year's play is Cinderella.
Here is the script.
This script is the popular version, but I want our original version.
What do you mean?
I want a modern story.
Let's decide on the cast.
Raise your hands for Cinderella.
Do you know anyone?
I know the perfect girl.
Maybe we can ask her.
Can you play Cinderella?
I'm not like a princess.
In our play, Cinderella is very powerful.
She finds her own happiness.
Now I want the role.
We have the final rehearsal on the 2nd.
How is your schedule, Saya?
When are your rehearsals?
Our rehearsals are on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.
I can come on Tuesdays and Fridays, but not on Saturdays.
Our rehearsals are in the afternoon.
I can go to rehearsal after practice but...
Do I have time for lunch?
You can eat before rehearsal.
Tommy, are you free on November 3rd?
And I am Cinderella!
Do you need me?
I can be the prince!
You are so funny!
The costumes are very unique.
You look so cute together.
Hi, I'm a salmon.
And I'm a California roll!
Wow, you are all sushi.
By the way, where is Dad's costume?
Oh, he doesn't get one.
I don't need one.
How about an onigiri costume?
I can make onigiri.
I can eat onigiri.
But I don't wear onigiri.
What do we need for the cupcakes, Jake?
Is this your mom's recipe?
We bake cupcakes every year on Halloween.
Then we add three cups of flour.
How many cupcakes can we make?
Yay, I can have four!
Let's put them in the oven.
Kota, your decoration looks great.
How many cupcakes do you want?
Take the train from the airport.
But don't take the express train.
Welcome to Japan, honey.
OK, kids, let's walk to our house.
How far is it?
Look at the yellow leaves.
The cherry blossoms in spring are amazing, too.
I love Wakaba-cho already.
By the way, is Sakaki near here?
And where is the house?
We are almost there!
Ah, that's Saya and Tommy.
So, Eva, are you here for the Cinderella performance?
Saya is Cinderella, and Jake is the prince.
My blue party dress has white paint on it.
It's the paint from the castle set.
Don't give up yet, Saya.
Cinderella doesn't give up.
Can we get the paint off?
Do we have an extra dress somewhere?
We can't find one.
What can we do?
Let's ask my mom.
She's in the audience.
My dress has paint on it.
That's a lot of paint.
Can you do something about this?
Do you have more white paint and a paintbrush?
Is it a butterfly?
It's a beautiful design.
This dress can get everyone's attention at the dance party.
Cinderella, the prince's dance party is tonight.
Comb our hair and brush our shoes.
Can I go, too?
You don't have a dress.
Stay here and clean the house.
I need a dress for the party.
But I don't have one.
Look at the trash can over there.
It's full of my sisters' old dresses!
You can use them.
Look at that strange dress.
You can't be here.
Get out of here.
It's my original design.
Shall we talk more?
I'm actually a maid.
But I love fashion.
You can be a designer.
With hard work, I can do it.
I go straight down the street.
Then I turn left.
It looks like a leaf.
Then, eat it with the stick.
How do I drink the tea?
It's bitter, but I like it a lot.
Do you have everything, Mom?
My bag is so heavy with Japanese gifts.
It's the giant octopus!
Tommy, are you OK?
Does he have an audition soon?
A new Hollywood film is looking for a Japanese actor.
It's the role of a Japanese chef.
I have a video audition.
Is it a big role?
This role has ten lines.
It's a big chance.
Can you help him with the video, Jake?
I'm auditioning for the role of the Japanese chef.
Hollywood is waiting for me!
Let's check the video.
Hey, it's pretty good!
To all my fans around the world, thank you.
I'm practicing my speech for the awards ceremony.
Your heart is already in Hollywood!
Are you ready, Saya?
I can't find my soccer uniform.
Is it in your locker at school?
You were excited about the new uniform.
My towel, socks and pants are here.
It's not in my room, but it's somewhere in the house.
Then check the other rooms.
Can you wait here?
What shall we do?
How was the hot spring?
The snow was cold, but the water was so warm.
Many tourists love it.
I want a hot spring at home.
This soba is amazing.
How do you make this dashi?
My dad is a chef.
Thank you for your omotenashi.
The food was delicious, and the room was comfortable.
Good luck with your restaurant.
Please visit us sometime.
Which one do you want, Ayame?
How about this bunny?
That penguin is cute, too.
I want the gorillas.
Yes, the big one and the tiny one.
You can only buy one with your otoshidama!
The roller coaster was great!
It's already 4 p.m.
It's for the audition for the graduation ceremony.
The winner can sing there.
Any student from MAA can try.
But it's not easy.
Yes, she changed her busy schedule.
So, are you in, Hina?
So you have another audition?
I can send you our fruit in syrup.
All right, then enjoy the fruit and do your best.
Thanks, Mom and Dad!
They all have their goals.
We can play with you, Ayame.
Let's go to the park.
How's your song, Hina?
Oh, it's a picture of us.
Yes, this is you, Sophy, Takumi and Kyle.
The title is, "Dreams Come True."
I found it over there.
No, it just says, "Top Secret" on the cover.
What do you mean, "personal"?
Are you ready for your audition next week?
I'm practicing my lines.
I know your secret.
Her song is great.
Did you get the results?
I... I'm going to sing at the graduation ceremony!
That was fantastic, Hina.
Your homemade sweets were delicious!
Come and visit us anytime!
We know Sophy and Takumi.
You're the future movie star, right?
Well, that's my dream.
Next year's going to be great, too.
Is the camera ready, Takumi?
Hina, this is my homeroom teacher.
Hello, I'm Nakata Atsushi.
We are here, right?
This is my roommate.
Where are you from?
This is my room, Dad.
Look, here it is!
Yes, it's a ring!
Is this your ring, Ms. Miller?
Yes, it's his wedding ring!
Is he your husband?
This is the music room.
MAA is a school for artists.
A piano, a guitar, a drum set...
Now it's my turn!
It's not easy, Kyle.
This is a recording studio.
You are very professional!
Sing a song, Hina.
You are very busy.
Everyone, your singing test is next week.
It's a difficult song.
Hina, are you okay?
The singing test is tomorrow.
This song is difficult!
Yes, I can do it!
I exercise here every day.
I'm a future action hero.
But the singing test is tomorrow, Kyle.
You are very kind.
Good luck with the test tomorrow, Hina!
I love your singing.
Do you like music?
Oh, it's time to go.
You are Lisa's rival?
Marina is a great town.
Sophy, how about that bench?
We can see the sea.
Hey, don't sit there!
Look at the sign!
May I help you?
Do you have dresses?
Please come this way.
So many pretty dresses!
How about this one?
Hina, are you ready?
That's a cute dress.
Your floral dress is beautiful, too!
Look at this sign.
This is my favorite place.
It has special books.
What kind of books?
Wait for me, Takumi!
Look at this book!
They are black and white photos.
They are so beautiful.
Look at the light and shadow.
This photographer is a genius!
You really like him!
I want this and this―and this, too.
Is that Kyle and Takumi?
Thank you for your help.
Kyle, you are a gentleman!
It's from my dad in France.
Here are your cousin's wedding photos.
Hey, Hina, can I send our photos to my family?
This one is nice.
Let's play table tennis inside.
I have an idea.
Rock, paper, scissors, go!
What are you doing?
Hey, guys, I have another plan!
Yes, come to our club.
It's not a bad idea... but no thanks.
Yes, maybe next time!
You like shodo, right?
Today's topic is "my favorite word."
Let's see Sophy's work.
My favorite word is "shodo"!
Thank you, Mr. Nakata!
Look, Lisa is in Anne of Green Gables.
She is the heroine.
Let's go and see her performance.
Sorry, I have plans with my uncle.
Then let's meet here at noon, Hina.
The theater is over there.
Wow, Lisa can perform in such a big theater!
Are the flowers for Lisa?
And the yellow ones are from a movie company.
And this white bouquet is from MAA!
It's hard for the performers.
The audience can watch them from every angle.
Wow, she looks different on stage.
I love your singing.
The stage set is great, too.
And how about this costume?
Your performance is very professional.
You can do it, too.
I have some crayons.
It's a pretty girl.
She has big eyes.
This is you, Hina!
Ayame, you're so sweet!
It's time for dinner, Ayame.
Let's play the coin game.
You are both wrong!
So, your uncle lives near here.
He loves marine sports.
He's a sports lover like me!
Maybe you don't look like your uncle.
You can see him on Sunday.
Are you ready, kids?
Sophy, are you okay?
It's my first time on a speedboat.
My uncle is a good boat driver.
You can see the town from here.
And I can see our school!
Sophy, open your eyes.
I see many people over there.
What is that sound?
It's the Marina Bay Fireworks Festival tonight.
I love Japanese fireworks.
It looks like a butterfly!
The air conditioner is broken!
I don't like the heat!
Then eat some ice cream.
It's not good for my stomach.
That's a good idea!
Can they come today?
It takes about a week.
Well, summer vacation starts soon.
You can go back to Hokkaido, right?
My mom and dad are very busy in summer.
I always help them during the vacation.
We have cows, sheep and a huge field.
We also run a cafe.
I need a model.
How do you like this photo?
Hina has a new friend!
It's one a.m. here!
Who is it, Kyle?
They're my friends from school.
Can I invite them here someday?
The steak is ready!
Kyle likes barbecue sauce.
No, I want soy sauce.
What is your best summer memory, Sophy?
The Shodo Club trip, of course.
I can't wait for the next one.
We practice shodo all day every day.
Is that a vacuum cleaner?
I always clean my own room.
He just watches TV, reads comic books and... oh, the snacks!
No, I make them.
He only eats them.
I have a souvenir from Miami.
We have a mango tree in our garden.
She makes smoothies, pies and cakes.
And my favorite is this―mango jam!
How does she make it?
...with sugar and lemon!
How do you know?
And this is from me―melon jam!
Summer vacation is over.
We have many events in the second term.
In November, we have our main event―the MAA Festival!
Ms. Bell, please tell us about the MAA Festival.
Well, it's a huge event.
You can do anything!
Can I sing in the concert?
My friends in Miami now have all new classes.
What do you mean?
And the summer vacation is almost three months long.
I want a long vacation, too!
Let's talk with Mr. Saionji!
You look at beautiful leaves and relax in nature.
We can pick mushrooms, too!
But wild mushrooms are dangerous.
I have a book on mushrooms.
Sorry, who is speaking?
Good afternoon, Mr. Saionji.
How can I help you?
Can I speak to Mr. Nakata?
Mr. Nakata, there you are!
Is it about the Shodo Club trip?
You have a very gentle voice.
What do you mean?
Here, this is the map to the house.
The cheerleaders' uniforms look great.
Hina, let's join the cheerleading team together.
Can I join, too?
Kyle, I have an important mission for you.
Good for you, Kyle!
But I'm a little worried.
I'm a super sprinter.
This is for you from Sophy and me.
My name is on it!
But you are not on our team, Sophy.
I know, but you're my friend.
We are number one!
Hina's a great cheerleader!
And next is your race, Takumi.
I need a Gemini girl.
Well, I'm not a Gemini and I'm not a girl...
Yes, Hina's a Gemini!
We can win this race!
Wait for me, Hina!
I can't run anymore.
Leonardo is also the anchor for his team.
But I can win.
Run like the wind, Kyle!
You can do it, Kyle!
You're our hero, Kyle!
This trophy is really heavy.
Look at the clock.
What time is it?
Actually, I'm very proud of you.
Hina, I have a clarinet concert next month.
I'm a little worried.
She doesn't have enough time for rehearsal.
Why is she so busy?
When is your clarinet lesson, Ayame?
She has drawing lessons on Thursdays.
Fridays are ballet lessons, and she goes to kindergarten every day.
She doesn't have any time.
Wow, she's so busy!
I have a great idea.
Well, we have a problem.
Ayame's clarinet is... somewhat...
Early in the morning is not a good idea.
Can you make miso soup?
You're a good chef, Hina.
Then Hina can make the soup, and I can eat it!
Don't be lazy, Kyle.
First, wash the potatoes.
We use kombu at home.
Yes, you can also use niboshi.
You need one tablespoon per person.
So, we need four tablespoons.
Put in the miso and stir gently.
Heat the soup and we are ready!
Enjoy your miso soup.
I have more soup.
That's too much, Kyle.
The orange and black lights look very mysterious.
The jack-o'-lantern over there is huge!
Welcome to Marina Market!
Is that a vampire?
Everyone wears costumes around Halloween.
Here comes Kyle the pirate!
Takumi, you're a zombie!
That's just a white kimono!
I see so many ghosts and monsters.
Try our pumpkin ice cream!
Have some pumpkin pie!
This ice cream is delicious.
The pumpkin pie is tasty, too.
This is a seaside town.
Is that you, Ayame?
Is that mummy your dad?
I can't see his face.
Why is Mr. Saionji here with Ayame?
Oh, you don't know?
He is my son, Ayame's father!
Now, let's paint the arch!
This year's theme is "Color Your Future."
We need red, yellow, blue―many colors!
Where is the paint?
Let's find another store.
It's on your right.
The festival handbook is ready.
Now, back to the list.
Welcome to MAA Festival!
So many people are here.
Mr. Kubota, nice to see you again.
Where are Takumi's photos?
The photo display is here on the map.
This is a nice photo of a streetcar.
The title is "Smile."
I can't see one.
The driver looks happy.
He loves his job.
Momotaro, this is Onigashima!
This akaoni is too strong.
What can I do?
Now, everyone can live in peace.
The students write words and create a work of art together.
MAA Shodo Club, go!
The theme is "Dream."
Thank you very much!
I'm an editor of an art magazine.
Just relax and smile!
Can you show me around the festival?
My grandpa and grandma are both busy now.
Let's go and see Lisa on stage.
It's time to go, Ayame.
You can come again next year and see me on stage.
But you look tired.
This is rose tea from Paris.
Yeah, I can't stop.
I don't play computer games.
Oh, I don't read much.
But this is really good.
It gets really dramatic.
Don't turn off the light!
I can't sleep now!
I was with my grandma, but she was asleep.
A chicken... is speaking?!
Open the window, now!
You're a good kid.
Let's go for a ride!
Paris is shining with lights!
So... chickens can fly?
I was up in the sky!
That's a nice... dream.
I can't find the chicken in the fridge!
So, was it a dream?
Anyway, now I don't eat chicken.
We were in the cafeteria.
Let's go back to the classroom.
Thanks for the great story, Sophy.
That's an old postcard.
In 1975, you were in Japan and I was in the U.S.
I'm always thinking of you...."
Is that a Christmas card, Kyle?
It's from my parents.
It says, "Merry Christmas!"
He's wearing a T-shirt!
In Miami, it's warm in December.
Everyone wears a T-shirt.
What's that in your hand, Sophy?
These are nengajo for my Shodo Club members.
What does it say?
I want Mermaid Marina-chan!
Oh, the airport mascot.
Where is the souvenir shop?
This notebook is so cute!
I love this pen, too.
That's a lot of shopping, Hina.
We don't have time.
But I'm still shopping!
You lose again, Daddy!
Daddy can never win.
That's a good idea.
Let's just buy ordinary beef.
I was thinking about fish.
I heard about the contest.
I started soccer at age five.
About five hours a day.
I practice soccer five hours a day, too.
Anyway, I hope you do well in the contest.
I feel confident now.
Luna, I have a request.
Well, if we win the cooking contest, can you and I go on a date?
Just one week from today.
The key is flavor and creativity.
It's Mia's victory dance!
Let's do our best, guys!
What is it, Kenny?
I put salt in the custard!
Just make it again.
We don't have time!
You can whip the eggs.
It's the \"International Lunch Box.\"
It's tasty, but is it creative?
Look at the box.
It's made of bread!
You can eat the box, too!
And the winner is... Marina Art Academy!
Nozomi Junior High School!
We won the creativity award!
He needs a new battery.
Let's go buy one!
Tama always helps us.
We must help him now!
Let's go find a battery!
Did Kenny and John find the right battery?
Let's go to Nozomi University!
They have a robotics lab.
Maybe they have a battery!
Why do you need a robot battery?
It's for our friend.
He's a samurai robot.
His name is Tamazaemon.
I follow him online!
So can we buy one?
But I can give you one!
Talk to him, Shunta.
Can you hear me?
You're back to normal, Tama!
You like Moon Wars movies, Luna?
Episode 2 is my favorite.
Oh, Luna, let's get popcorn!
I can take it to our seats.
Here are our popcorn and drinks, Luna!
Wow, that's a lot!
Do you like cola?
Here are your glasses.
This movie is in 3D.
Ready to travel to space?
This is for you.
A Moon Wars meteorite pendant?!
At the gift shop.
Tama, close your eyes.
A kiss on the cheek!
See you at school, Tama.
My head hurts, and I'm exhausted.
Maybe you should go to the nurse's office.
That's a good idea.
I know the cause.
So, what's the problem?
Try some chamomile tea.
Warm milk is good, too.
Thanks for the advice.
I hope you sleep well tonight.
Is that a bottle of medicine on the table?
You don't sound or look sick.
I'm feeling much better.
Can I see that bottle?
Oh, honey, are you okay?
Still, I'm worried about you!
Your mother and I had a fight last night.
She was angry, but...
Nami... last night... I ate your pudding.
So, you're not leaving?
But, isn't this your suitcase?
John, is this your luggage?
No, it's not mine.
Look at the Statue of Liberty pin.
But why is your luggage here?
I'm sending my things back to New York.
Why are you sending them back to New York?
Actually, Betty broke her leg.
I need to help her.
I must move back to New York.
Shunta, I heard about Tama.
Hey, let's have a farewell party for Tama!
Are you free this weekend?
You're going away, too?
I'm going to play soccer in Argentina.
I want to become a world-class player.
But... what about Mia?
Don't you... like her?
But... you spend so much time with Mia.
My only love is soccer.
You should ask her out!
It's on Sunday, right?
Where are you going to hold the party?
How about my restaurant?
It gets busy from the evening, but around 2 p.m. is fine.
Do you like it?
The whole class worked together.
And what a feast!
Shunta and I cooked it.
We made it for you, Tama!
This is from us.
We made a book of memories.
Turn to the last page.
\"To the best robot in the universe.\"
In New York, I spent my time freely.
But in Japan, I went to school and followed the rules.
Thanks for everything, everybody!
Don't... don't go, Tama!
What is Shunta doing?
He's just studying quietly in his room.
But Shunta can get past it.
T, T, T... Tama?!
A samurai robot from New York.
What are you doing here?!
Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you, too!
My leg is better now, so I brought Tama back to Japan.
Mom, Dad, why didn't you tell me before?
It's a wonderful surprise!
Tama told me all about you, Shunta.
What did he say?
Yeah, he's like my younger brother.
I'm the older brother!
You two are close.
Let's tell everyone about your return!
But, can we wait until tomorrow?
I want to spend today with family.
Please come to my house anytime!
It's not your house, it's my house!
Hiroshi and Nami are so kind.
Shunta is my new brother!
I have a new family member, too.
Now it's your turn.
I am a great back-rubber.
No, Tama, it's okay!
Welcome to Chan's Chinese Restaurant!
It's my family's restaurant.
You help too, right, Kenny?
Um... who are you?
They are my sister and brother.
They look the same.
Here is the menu.
Six of those please!
You're a great player!
Do you play soccer, too?
We don't play, but we can cheer for you!
We can light them in the yard.
No, it's not that.
About the math test next period!
I am ready, I guess, but I have no confidence.
Kenny, do you know my favorite phrase?
I can do it!
Let's go to Okinawa this summer!
This is a big aquarium!
That's a whale shark.
And that's a manta!
Okinawa is so magical.
This is only a small part of Okinawa!
Dad is on the launch team!
Can we watch the launch?
You can watch from the house.
So, Shunta, you live with John and Tama?
Well, Tama does yoga every morning.
It's a kind of slow exercise.
Oh, that sounds good!
Maybe I can do it, too!
Have a nice night!
You, too, Ms. Ueda.
Are Sundays and Mondays off?
It's a quiz about the town.
Maybe we can help you!
I write a lot of articles about our city.
You're an excellent salesperson, Tama.
Do you need help with anything?
Oh, thank you for the offer Judy.
But we're all set.
Are Miki and Maki the only twins in the family?
I have a twin sister.
And my brothers are twins, too.
Two sets of twins!
It is a symbol of this amusement park.
The Swing Tower it is!
Oh, I'm still dizzy!
Then let's go to the game corner.
That's a good idea.
Do you have any final advice for us, Ms. Supershot?
Rhythm is the key.
OK, girls, this is it!
You can do it!
Here, Peter, try this.
It is a special tsukudani with beef and burdock root.
Admission is free for children and students in grades 1-12.
She comes here at least once a month.
Wow, this museum is really big!
First, we should see Hachiko and Jiro.
I know Hachiko, but who is Jiro?
She always tells us about the story of Taro and Jiro.
Oh, it is a wonderful story of love and endurance!
The ozoni is ready.
You have a message from... the Voice from the Sky?
It's four minutes after 11 o'clock!
The "hands" on Big Ben look like...
Next, a huge shadow.
Are you OK, Hime-pyon?
Hmm... I don't see anything around us.
I'll use my magic telepathy.
He's not a monster.
What are you doing up there?
You missed me, huh?
He lives down in that ice valley.
It's a special place for dinosaurs.
Do you live with your family?
Oh, you live with your parents and relatives.
You were taking a nap, and Peek-a-boo woke you up?
Say sorry to him, Peek-a-boo!
What's wrong with your tummy?
Hey, somebody is coming out of that cave!
Oh, he's so handsome.
His clothes are so cool!
Let's change our clothes, too!
Please help my brother!
Oh, he's burning up!
Peek-a-boo is on fire?!
He has a high fever!
You saved my brother's life!
Oh, he looks so cool!
Who cares about looks?
I like a brave guy.
Let's make sukiyaki tonight!
Vegetables, tofu, shirataki noodles, and beef.
And we dip them in raw egg.
Let's buy the eggs first.
This one looks good.
That's our special \"Nozomi beef.\"
It melts in your mouth!
Let's get it, Hiroshi!
It's three thousand yen for one hundred grams.
Don't you want Nozomi beef?
I can't wait to eat this deluxe sukiyaki!
After dinner, I played igo with my grandpa.
Does he know the rules?
He's a master at games.
How was your vacation?
I went to a CD shop in Tokyo.
And... \"NZM44\" were there!
I can't wash this hand ever again!
Shunta, Tama, how about you guys?
We went to Nagano.
You can ski, snowboard, and ice-skate there.
Tama doesn't like the cold.
I stayed inside the lodge.
John and I enjoyed the hot springs.
They had many kinds, but the outdoor bath was the best.
The snowy scenery was beautiful.
It was the perfect vacation!
Ms. Ueda, are you okay?
This is nothing... oops!
The teacher's room, please.
By the way, look at this.
\"Junior high cooking contest.\"
Do you want to compete in it?
Are you sure, Shunta?
You're so positive now!
Thanks to a little samurai robot.
We need to practice before the contest.
Can we use the cooking room every day?
Do your best, boys!
So, what shall we make?
We need an original recipe.
Let's make something big!
Let's make something sweet!
Our ideas are all different.
Well, let's discuss it some more.
You two look sleepy.
Were you practicing for the contest?
I practiced my frying pan skills.
And I wrote the recipe.
Did you finish it?
And today we cook it.
What do you like about cooking?
Everybody loves delicious food.
Just like a good soccer game!
Are you a robot, too?
Where are you from?
I'm a cool robot.
Oh, you are my dad's friend.
Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you, too!
Welcome to our home!
This is a homemade apple pie.
Shunta can cook, and Tama can eat!
Can you read that phone number?
Can you start again, please?
You have a lot of luggage.
This is Tama's luggage.
I have a lot of clothes.
He's a very stylish robot.
That's a robot part.
Oh, and Tama is your robot.
No, he is my son.
Let's stop for today.
Tomorrow is the school entrance ceremony.
Shunta, Tama, it's bedtime.
Wow... apple pie... chocolate... ice cream...
Tama is already asleep.
Um, where is Nozomi Junior High?
I‘m a student there, too.
My name is Mia.
The school is this way.
I love Italian food!
I'm from Hong Kong.
My family has a Chinese restaurant.
I like Chinese food.
Come to our restaurant anytime!
We are all in Class A.
Actually, I'm a little sad.
I'm in Class B.
We're in different classes.
Oh, that's too bad.
He's in the junior soccer league.
I watch his games at the stadium sometimes.
Let's go together next time!
I'm your homeroom teacher, Ueda Eri.
Good morning, Ms. Ueda.
Welcome to my class.
Now, here is your ALT.
An ALT is an Assistant Language Teacher.
Come in, Mr. Smith!
My name is John Smith.
Is he a samurai?
Tama is a samurai robot.
And he is your classmate, too.
You and Mr. Smith live at Shunta's house, right?
That sounds really fun!
This card is for you.
Today's lunch is curry and rice, salad, fruit, and milk.
I like all of those!
Melon is a very special fruit, Tama!
For this special fruit, I need this.
It's not a samurai sword, it's a fork.
Now, time to eat!
This is my sister.
My name is Luna.
Your face is red, and you're hot.
I really like her!
She's a third-year student.
And she's the student council secretary.
Lunchtime is almost over!
School is really fun.
I have many friends.
But John, you look tired!
I teach every day, and I work on robots every night.
Do you want some medicine?
I know the reason.
Can you rub my shoulders?
Mmm, this fried rice is delicious!
And the noodles are excellent.
He sleeps with it every night.
Lynn, Nick, stop it!!
Shunta, is this your hat?
Oh, that's my favorite hat!
All gentlemen wear hats.
Do you like it?
Soccer, baseball, tennis... so many clubs!
I choose the dance club.
You can dance, Mia?
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3...
Let's all join together!
I don't like dancing.
You like cooking, right?
You can join the cooking club!
Yeah, but... we don't have a cooking club.
You can start one!
So, is it possible, Ms. Ueda?
Of course it is, Shunta!
I can ask the principal.
Please give me a day or two.
So, can we start a cooking club?
Yes, but you need three members.
Well... we have Shunta, me...
You have a club!
Here are today's ingredients.
Well, what's on today's menu?
The answer is... cookies!
Mix the flour, sugar and butter.
What about the shape of the cookies?
Okay, let's make stars!
Ooh, that smells good.
Be careful, they're hot.
Try some fresh baked cookies!
Mmm, they're so sweet.
Oh, let's give some to Mia as a present.
But let's clean up first.
Come to my house!
I'm sorry, but I'm busy at the restaurant.
Tama, are you ready?
I can't choose an outfit.
But this striped one is stylish too.
Or maybe the checked one...
But this is important!
Wow, these Japanese sweets are great.
That's a strawberry daifuku.
It has anko and a strawberry inside.
Oh, it's this high-rise apartment building.
Yeah, and so fancy!
Look, that's a security guard.
It's just like my apartment building in New York!
Thank you for inviting us.
I live on the sixtieth floor.
That's the top floor!
Wow, you live in the penthouse!
Here, these are handmade strawberry daifuku.
Maisonette apartments are very popular in New York.
You can see the whole city from here.
And that's our house!
Oh, I see it!
It's just far away....
She's in her room.
I can get her.
Can I use a mirror first?
The restroom is down the hall.
Tama, you really like Luna.
Um, where is the living room?
Can I join you guys?
What is it, John?
I don't have the right parts for this robot car.
What kind of parts?
Can you buy them at the shop?
Oh, no, they're sold out.
We can think of something!
Can you use those for tires?
What about empty cans?
That's a good idea!
We have juice cans, tuna, fruit...
Thanks, you two, but it's not possible.
I can't make your robot car.
And boats don't have tires.
That's a great idea!
What a huge stadium!
It's the home stadium of our pro soccer team.
It's a VIP pass.
We can go anywhere with this.
You have a VIP pass?!
Look, it's kickoff time!
Look at that forward!
He is so fast!
Oh, he's the pro team's coach.
He's on TV sometimes.
And, he's my dad.
Oh, so your VIP pass...
Just like you and Luna!
So this is a Japanese festival.
Where are Mia and Kenny?
Hey, Shunta, what's that?
It's so cute and fluffy!
One cotton candy, please!
They sell many things at Japanese festivals.
I want the koala mask.
And for you, Mia?
I can win a toy for you.
Oh, it's a miss.
I can do this!
I love the big, star-shaped fireworks!
I like handheld fireworks.
Come to my house sometime!
I don't feel well.
Shall we go to the nurse's office?
That sounds good, but John can't go.
You're lonely without John, right?
He is lonely without me.
Well, let's ask him anyway.
We can play with Grandma, Grandpa and Hachi!
He's a really good dog.
Actually, I can't go to Okinawa!
The blue water and white sand―it's fantastic!
Oh, let's take a photo with the ocean!
Okay... and... it's uploaded!!
Someone already \"likes\" it!
Is it online already?
Is that a dog on the gate?
No, that's not a dog.
It's an Okinawan guardian totem.
It's a real dog!
Get away from Tama!
Now, let's go sightseeing!
How about the aquarium?
Well, class, summer is over.
Welcome to the fall term.
We compete against the other classes, so we need teamwork.
We can sell apple pie!
You don't eat the food, Tama.
I know, but we can taste it first, right?
Halloween is in fall, too!
Some people wear costumes in Japan, too.
Do you dress up for Halloween, Shunta?
Let's dress up together!
I can design our costumes!
This museum is crowded.
Dali is a very popular artist.
Look at that sign.
That's the line for tickets.
We already have ours, so we can go in.
Let's take a photo!
Do you see that sign?
You don't need a camera, Mia.
You can keep the memory in your heart.
The wind feels so nice!
Let's get some drinks at that juice stand.
Shop employees need breaks, too, I guess.
Let's find a vending machine.
Where is the bus stop?
Let's check the map.
It's near the south gate.
Where's the south gate?
Well, it's to the south.
But which way is south?
Um... I don't know!
Tell us more about Tama.
He's like a cleaning robot!
He says it's good exercise.
And it's very helpful for us.
It kills two birds with one stone!
Tama does the laundry.
Well, does he iron his clothes?
No, Tama does that, too.
So, John doesn't do any housework.
He stays in his room, usually.
But I hear strange sounds sometimes.
What kind of sounds?
And kind of scary....
This is Ms. Ueda.
Oh, hello, Ms. Ueda!
May I speak to John, please?
John is not here right now.
Can I help you?
Actually, John's mobile phone is still on his desk.
It's here at school.
The phone is robot-shaped...
That's John's phone for sure.
Tell him, \"Please come back and pick up your phone.\"
Your mobile phone is on your desk at school.
I don't have it!
Go back to school and get it.
The tug of war is next.
Believe in yourself, everybody!
Every ball is on target!
He's on his power mode.
Out of the way, everyone!
Our class is the winner!
Tama, are you okay?
I'm tired... Shunta, please...
I want lots of sweets!
Leave it to me!
Thanks for your hard work.
We need a new dessert for the restaurant.
I have an idea!
Hmm, I don't know.
Well, let's make it!
First, put it in a bowl and stir.
Next, add twenty grams of sugar.
Great job, you two!
You're a great teacher!
Seventy grams of flour and three grams of baking powder.
Add fifty milliliters and stir well.
Then, put it all in a frying pan.
What a beautiful color!
Let's put lychee and mango on the plate.
You are a genius chef, Shunta!
Aaron, today is your interview with the Nozomi Monthly, right?
How do you know?
Well, actually... my mom's the editor.
She's your interviewer today!
Tell me about your daily routine.
I go for a run in the park and do soccer exercises.
I come straight to the stadium and practice.
I train alone on Mondays, and we have games on Sundays.
Do you get tired of it?
No, I love it.
When does the interview come out?
You can find it at the supermarket and the station.
Nami, you're just like a pro interviewer!
I am a professional, Tama.
I love the jack-o-lanterns!
It's just like in New York.
This costume... I'm embarrassed...
You are a handsome and powerful samurai!
We're the three samurai brothers!
It's Mia and Kenny!
Devil Mia and wolfman Kenny!
Someone... something is after us.
What do you mean?
Is that a real ghost?
Let's find it and catch it!
Don't leave me behind....
Take me with you....
I know that voice.
Do you like my costume?
And the Halloween fun begins.
That class has a short film screening!
And that one has a haunted house.
According to this pamphlet, it's on the third floor.
Shunta is Mia's friend.
What is the name of our town's new rocket?
What flower is our city's symbol?
The prize is candy.
You know a lot about this town.
And I read them!
Your shop is crowded.
The cafe is full.
Can you take some orders, Tama?
Table A wants four apple pies, one orange juice, and three teas.
You have a great memory!
Here's your apple pie!
And for you, and you!
Tama can carry so many plates!
Well then, let's work hard, too!
The cafe is a success!
Thanks to you, Tama.
Can I help at your restaurant too, Kenny?
Let's take a break.
I'm ready to work!
It's the perfect season for autumn leaves!
Let's go to the pond!
Hurry up, big brother!
Don't be so loud.
What are you doing?
Your new bike is so cool, Tama!
It's a present from John.
This is so easy... whoah, whooooah!
I can't ride my new bike.
Now I can ride it!
John is a great engineer!
First, we take the bus.
Then, we go up the mountain.
We can take the escalator to the platform.
Tama and I are by the bench.
I see lots of benches.
You can see the whole city from here.
I can't see the entrance.
What can you see?
Oh no, that's the wrong bus stop!
Shunta, go get her!
I can get you, Mia!
Thanks for coming, Shunta!
Yeah, thanks a lot.
I'm here for the rocket launch.
Can I join you?
Umm... yeah, of course....
The launch is at three.
Let's play a card game.
It's my favorite soccer channel.
Can I join you?
Shunta, you can play with Kenny.
This soccer channel is really exciting!
I watch it for research sometimes.
You can plug the cord into me.
The rocket is heading for space!
Look at all the light and smoke!
It's an unforgettable sight.
I'm texting my dad.
About the rocket launch?
Please tell him thank you for me!
But Tama, you can tell him yourself tonight.
We can find it, Tama.
Oh, your special fork?
It was in the gym!
I was there for dodgeball at recess!
I'm sure it's still in the gym.
I don't see it.
How about you, Mia?
Let's go to the school broadcasting studio.
We can ask everybody!
My special fork is missing.
Is this your fork?
It's my very special fork!
In the Kendo Club room.
How about this one?
Mom's eyes are closed.
My smile isn't good.
I like this photo.
That is a nice one!
Now let's write a message.
\"We all really enjoy Japan.
School here is great.
Mom often cooks Japanese food.
Dad's soccer team looks good this season.
We can't wait to see you!
It's a card from Betty in New York!
It's a Christmas card.
\"Please, don't worry about us.
Tora and I are very well.\"
It's a New Year's card for my friend.
What does it say?
Is it a dog?
No, it's a boar!
Next year is the Year of the Boar.
L, L, L... Luna!
We're buying cleaning supplies.
After that, we decorate the entrance and prepare soba.
Wow, you're so busy!
People come from around the world for it.
Come and see it anytime!
I can show you around New York.
The color red is good luck in Italy.
Let's buy something red for our grandparents!
How about these stylish red socks?
They have a rocket pattern.
It's a heat pack.
It warms you up.
Well, see you next year!
Good luck with cleaning!
Have a Happy New Year!
